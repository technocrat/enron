# Course Instructions
For this project, you will be applying machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression. You will have the opportunity to use a publicly available dataset to solve the problem of your choice. The UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle are good places to seek out a dataset. Kaggle also maintains a curated list of datasets that are cleaned and ready for machine learning analyses.

The ability to clearly communicate the process and insights gained from an analysis is an important skill for data scientists. You will submit a report that documents your analysis and presents your findings, with supporting statistics and figures. The report must be written in English and uploaded as both a PDF document and an Rmd file. Although the exact format is up to you, the report should include the following at a minimum:

an introduction/overview/executive summary section that describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed;
a methods/analysis section that explains the process and techniques used, such as data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, any insights gained, and your modeling approach;
a results section; and
a conclusion section.
The submission for the choose-your-own project will be three files: a report in the form of both a PDF document and Rmd file and the R script or Rmd file that performs your machine learning task. We recommend submitting a link to a GitHub repository with these files and your dataset.
an introduction/overview/executive summary section that describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed
