 [2] "                                        Summary\n        This report reviews the performance of the California ISO’s real-time energy and\nancillary services markets over the past 18 months, with particular emphasis on the\nrelative performance of these markets during the summer of 1999 versus the summer of\n1998. We offer recommendations for correcting some of the remaining market design\nflaws identified in previous MSC reports. We also identify several flaws in the market\ndesign that have revealed themselves since our March 1999 report was submitted.\nRecommendations for correcting these market design flaws are provided. Finally, we\ndescribe several long-term changes in market design that we believe should be\nimplemented to facilitate the transparency of hourly wholesale market prices to retail\nelectricity customers.\n        The performance of the ISO’s ancillary services markets during the summer of\n1999 appears to be significantly improved relative to the same month during the summer\nof 1998, based on market prices, market requirements, and bid sufficiency frequencies.\nHowever, a substantial proportion of this improvement in market performance can be\nattributed to lower average hourly total system loads during the summer of 1999 relative\nto the summer of 1998.\n        We find that significant market power remains in California’s wholesale energy\nmarket during periods of high total system load, which primarily occur during the\nsummer months. We find that for the majority of summer months in 1999, for the same\nlevel of total system load, real-time energy prices were higher in 1999 than in 1998.\nNevertheless, the total amount of market power exercised during the summer month of\n1999 that we have data for appears to be significantly less than that exercised during that\nsame month in 1998. We also present evidence that suggests that the opportunities for\nthe exercise of market power in the ISO’s ancillary services markets are greater when\nthese markets are cleared on a zonal versus statewide basis.\n        The outstanding market design flaws identified in previous MSC reports are: (1)\nrules for dispatching Reliability Must-Run (RMR) contract generation units, (2) the lack\nof a price-responsive hourly wholesale electricity demand, and (3) the inability of utility\ndistribution company loads to forward contract for their energy and ancillary services\ndemands outside of the PX markets.\n        Market design flaws identified since the April 1999 MSC report are: (1) the\nincentives for generation unit owners to create and profit from resolving intra-zonal\ncongestion, (2) non-compliance of generation unit owners with ISO technical standards\nfor providing energy and ancillary services capacity, and (3) the lack of incentives for\nprice-responsive retail demand caused by the current California “stranded asset” recovery\nmechanism.\n        Long-term market redesign issues analyzed are: (1) ISO policy for new zone\ncreation, (2) ISO policy for new generation interconnection, (3) retail competition\npolicies when any one of the three investor-owned utilities ends its stranded asset\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 1 of 148\n"

 [3] "recovery period, and (4) mechanisms for selling Pacific Gas and Electric’s hydroelectric\nfacilities to enhance the competitiveness of the California wholesale electricity market.\n         This report provides recommendations for addressing each issue. We continue to\nadvocate pre-dispatch and mandatory day-ahead scheduling of RMR capacity as market-\nefficiency enhancing, consistent with the market design principles of the California\nmarket, and necessary for a workably competitive wholesale electricity market.\n         Because of remaining market power in the California wholesale electricity market\nand the lack of incentives for a price-responsive hourly retail demand created by the\nCalifornia market’s stranded asset recovery mechanism, we continue to advocate that the\nISO have the authority to impose a purchase price cap on its energy and ancillary services\nmarkets, at least until all remaining major market design flaws are eliminated. We\nadvocate that the ISO maintain the current $750/MW price cap at least through the end of\nthe summer of 2000. At this time, enough information on the performance of the ISO’s\nmarkets under the new ancillary services market design and new RMR contracts (with the\npre-dispatch and day-ahead scheduling reforms suggested above) will be available to\nevaluate whether removal or raising of this price cap is warranted.\n         We recommend revising the ISO’s intra-zonal congestion management protocols\nto create strong incentives for market participants to eliminate rather than cause intra-\nzonal congestion. A framework for determining the advisability of creating new\ncongestion zones from a market power perspective is given. Based on the market power\nanalysis presented in this report and incentives for creating intra-zonal congestion under\ncurrent ISO protocols, we believe that the ISO should exercise restraint in creating new\ncongestion zones, unless it feels that system reliability will be significantly enhanced by\ncreating a new congestion zone.\n         We also recommend that the ISO monitor the FTR market and establish position\nlimits on the quantity of FTR capacity controlled by any single market participant\n(including affiliates) during the initial stages of the operation of this market. Because of\nthe several features of the FTRs offered by the ISO, there may be opportunities for\ncertain market participants purchasing a large fraction of the FTR capacity on certain\ntransmission paths to profit from subsequently creating inter-zonal congestion in the day\nahead energy market.\n         To provide incentives for retail competition that increases the responsiveness of\nhourly retail demand to hourly wholesale electricity and ancillary services prices, we\nrecommend the adoption of a default provider retail rate in the post-rate-freeze period\nthat reduces the original rate-freeze retail rate by some fraction of the previous year’s\nannual average stranded asset recovery, rather than one that passes-through hourly\nwholesale energy and ancillary services costs according to a representative load profile.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 2 of 148\n"

 [6] "1.       Introduction and Summary\n         This report analyzes the performance of the ISO’s energy and ancillary services\nmarkets since the previous Market Surveillance Committee (MSC) report was submitted\nto the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on March 25, 1999. We offer\nrecommendations for correcting some of the remaining market design flaws identified in\nprevious MSC reports. We also identify several flaws in the market design that have\nrevealed themselves since our March report was submitted. Recommendations for\ncorrecting these market design flaws are provided as well. Finally, this report describes\nseveral long-term changes in market design that we believe should be implemented to\nfacilitate the transparency of hourly wholesale market prices to retail electricity\ncustomers. These changes should be implemented before the Competition Transition\nCharge (CTC) period, during which the original investor-owned utilities (IOUs) receive\npayment for their \"stranded assets,\" ends.\n         A.      Assessing the Performance of the ISO's Markets\n                 1.     Status of Redesign of Ancillary Services Markets\n         Since our last report, the ISO has implemented or will soon be implementing a\nnumber of ancillary service (A/S) market reforms.                   These reforms and their\nimplementation dates are summarized below and many are described more fully in the\nbody of this report.\nMarket Reform

 [7] "                  2.        Data Currently Available\n        Because many of the major ancillary services market redesign changes have only\nrecently been implemented, the MSC has been unable to analyze comprehensively many\nof the issues FERC requested that the MSC address in this report. In particular, the vast\nmajority of the design changes in the ISO’s ancillary services markets were implemented\non August 18, 1999, leaving the MSC with, at best, less than one-month’s worth of data\non market outcomes to use to determine the impact of these changes on market\nperformance. Given the dramatically different load conditions between August and\nSeptember 1999 and these same two months during 1998, these limited data are\ninsufficient to provide any definitive assessment of the success of the ancillary services\nmarket re-design process. Several of the other ancillary services market re-design\nelements were implemented very recently, and others have yet to be implemented.\nBecause of the comprehensive and interrelated nature of these market reforms, any\nassessment of their success given the data available at present would be premature.\n        The major Reliability-Must-Run (RMR) reforms were implemented effective June\n1, 1999. A complete assessment of these reforms is also constrained by data availability.\nThe ISO’s settlement data on actual metered unit-level electricity production and take-\nout-point electricity consumption on an hourly basis is currently only available through\nJuly 26, 1999.1 This information is an essential input to a full assessment of the\nperformance of the California energy market. Nevertheless, we offer a detailed analysis\nof the performance of the California energy market up to this date.\n        Although our focus is on the ancillary services markets and real-time energy\nmarkets, because of the very strong interactions among these markets and the PX markets\n(as emphasized in the our previous reports), the ISO's markets cannot be understood in\nisolation from the PX day-ahead and hour-ahead markets.\n        Despite the fact that data constraints prevent us from assessing the impact of\nISO’s recent market design changes, we note number of outstanding design flaws,\nincluding several that have become more noticeable since the March 1999 report.\n                  3.        Performance of the ISO’s Markets is Improving\n        From October 1998 to June 1999 market performance in the California energy\nmarket is what would be expected from a workably competitive market. We attribute this\nin no small part to the fact that this period was characterized by low levels of total ISO\nload relative those that occur during peak hours in the summer months. In addition,\nduring many of these months, electricity from hydroelectric facilities was plentiful. The\nperformance of the California energy market over this time period is encouraging. Given\nsystem and weather conditions over this time period, it is not surprising, and certainly\ndoes not imply that the ISO's markets will be workably competitive under more\ndemanding load conditions.\n1\n  Some of our data is available more recently than July 1999. For example, we are able to track bids and\nmarket-clearing prices through August 31,1999. We also analyze selected data on market-clearing prices\nand quantities recently through October 1, 1999.\n                             MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 6 of 148\n"

 [8] "        Our basis for concluding that the performance of the market has improved comes\nfrom analyzing many of the indices discussed in our previous reports. We find that the\nfrequency of price spikes in the ancillary services markets that cannot be explained by\nhigh load conditions has been significantly reduced. Generally, the price caps have been\nhit in the energy and ancillary services markets during late 1998 and early 1999 when\ntotal ISO load has been fairly high. This observation tends to support the view that, at\nleast most of the time, prices reflect underlying demand and supply conditions rather than\nthe exercise of market power. We are also encouraged by the fact that total ancillary\nservices costs as a fraction of total energy costs have continually fallen from late 1998\nthrough August 1999.\n        There are several reasons for the apparent improvement in the performance of\nthese markets. A number of market design changes have been implemented; these\nshould improve the efficiency of the market. Furthermore, the ISO continues to learn and\nimprove its operations. Specifically, we present evidence that the ISO has managed to\nuse less of certain ancillary services to provide reserve capacity for the same level of total\nISO load. In addition, the ISO has embarked on a comprehensive plan to improve the\ncompliance of market participants with the technical standards associated with providing\nthe various ancillary services. For example, when the ISO procures a 10-minute\nresponse-time service it can easily verify if that is what it is actually getting. This\nincreased monitoring, combined with penalization for non-compliance, has improved the\nquality of ancillary services capacity submitted to the various ISO markets. These\nmonitoring and enforcement activities also have increased the likelihood that, if called on\nto provide real-time energy, a unit owner can and will actually provide that energy under\nthe terms at which the associated capacity was bid into the market.\n        The very mild weather conditions experienced in California during the summer of\n1999 are probably the single most important factor behind the apparent improvements in\nmarket performance. The ability of firms to exercise market power requires sufficiently\nhigh load conditions, which is typically due to very hot weather. During these time\nperiods, all generators know that they stand little likelihood of not being called to provide\neither energy or ancillary services, even if they bid significantly in excess of their\nproduction costs. However, when the weather is mild, the demand for electricity is\nsignificantly lower relative to available generation capacity. All generation unit owners\nknow that under these load conditions they stand a significant likelihood of not being\ncalled to provide energy or ancillary services if they bid sufficiently in excess of their\nmarginal cost of production. Consequently, a true test of the success of the ancillary\nservices and other market reforms must await a time period when system load conditions\nare at or above those experienced during the summer of 1998, a period with very high\nsystem loads.\n                4.      Market Power Persists\n        Despite these improvements, our analysis of the recent data from the summer of\n1999 reveal that market power persists in the ISO's markets, particularly during periods\nof high system load. During these time periods, price movements across hours of the day\nare significantly in excess of the increased costs of supplying power during these hours.\n                          MSC Report,

 [9] "During these time periods, even the highest-cost generation unit supplying energy is\nbeing paid according to a price significantly in excess of its marginal production cost in\nthat hour. This is a direct indication of market power.\n          We have limited data from the summer of the 1999 with which to perform a\ndefinitive analysis of the exercise of market power during these months. However, for\nthe one month we do have data, July 1999, we see evidence of continued exercise of\nmarket power. Specifically, we calculated market clearing prices assuming a “pure”\ncompetitive market benchmark, compared them to actual energy costs in those hours, and\nfound the actual costs to be on average 20% above those predicted by this benchmark\nmarket outcome. Although below the value of this spread in July 1998 of 38%, the\nspread for July 1999 remains unacceptably high.2 It is important to note that the\nexistence of this amount of market power in the California wholesale electricity market\ndoes not imply that the annual total cost (including wholesale electricity and ancillary\nservices costs) of delivering electricity to final consumers in California is higher than it\nwould have been if the vertically-integrated monopoly regime had continued.\n          Our analysis of market conditions following the recent increase in the price cap in\nthe ISO’s energy and ancillary services markets from $250/MW to $750/MW (on\nOctober 1, 1999) shows that under certain system conditions (which could occur with\nsome frequency during the summer and early fall), prices in both the energy and ancillary\nservices markets can rise to their maximum levels, well above marginal production costs.\nThe evidence therefore supports the need for some level of price protection for buyers\nuntil we can review market performance next summer and confirm that the extent of the\nexercise of market power has substantially decreased.\n                  5.       Underlying Causes of Market Power\n          The underlying causes of market power in the ISO's markets are no different from\nthose leading to market power in other markets. Buyers have a limited ability to\nsubstitute to other products (inelastic demand). Suppliers from outside the market have\nlimited ability (usually due to transmission constraints) to offer their product for sale\n(inelastic supply). There is also concentration among sellers, and certain existing\nregulatory rules further reduce flexibility on the supply and demand side of the market.\n          Final hourly retail demand is virtually price inelastic with respect to the hourly\nwholesale price of electricity. This is due in large part due to California’s retail rate\nfreeze that severs the link between hourly wholesale energy costs and retail prices paid\nfor electricity consumed. The current combined retail rate freeze and stranded asset\nrecovery mechanism eliminates any incentive retail customers have to install hourly\nmeters and purchase their electricity according to rates that vary with hourly wholesale\nenergy and ancillary service prices. This mechanism eliminates virtually any incentive\nenergy services providers (ESPs) have to install real-time meters and bill their customers\naccording to rates that vary with hourly wholesale energy and ancillary service prices.\n2\n  This figure was computed using the methodology described in \"Diagnosing Market Power in California's\nRestructured Wholesale Electricity Market,\" Severin Borenstein, James Bushnell, and Frank Wolak,\nUniversity of California Energy Institute, July 1999.

[10] "        Supply remains fairly concentrated, although the recent divestiture of much of\nPacific Gas and Electric’s fossil fuel capacity to Southern Company has reduced the\nconcentration of generation ownership in the NP15 congestion zone. Still, particularly\nduring hot weather days, demand conditions are such that certain suppliers are “pivotal”\nand their bids can have a large effect on the price of energy or any of the ancillary\nservices during certain hours of the day.\n        Concerns about market power for a given ancillary service are exacerbated during\nperiods of peak demand for that service and during periods of inter-zonal transmission\nconstraint in the day-ahead energy market. Periods of peak demand for certain ancillary\nservices need not coincide with periods of peak demand for electricity. For example, the\nISO's peak demand for regulation typically arises during the shoulder periods on days\nwhen energy demand is peaking. Inter-zonal transmission constraints creates smaller\ngeographic markets which can lead to greater opportunities for generation unit owners to\nexercise market power within each congestion zone.\n        Finally, it is important to emphasize that the California energy and ancillary\nservices markets remain a work in progress. Key elements of this market are still not in\nplace: complete reform of the RMR contracts, meaningful compliance (e.g., the ability of\nthe ISO to verify that suppliers of ancillary services indeed stand ready to offer those\nservices as promised), and various ISO operating practices, software upgrades, and the\nlike.\n        B.      Short-Term Recommendations\n                1.      Complete the Design of California Markets\n        The ISO is still in the process of implementing various market designs that,\nhopefully, will improve the efficiency of the ISO's markets. Over the past year, this\nprocess has focused on the redesign of the ancillary services markets, although significant\nefforts are underway which are aimed at improving the responsiveness of the real-time\nenergy BEEP stack.\n        A major outcome of the ancillary services re-design process is the implementation\nof the Rational Buyer protocols. The ISO has also adopted ancillary services\nprocurement practices that have improved the liquidity of the hour-ahead ancillary\nservices market, by delaying some of its ancillary services purchases from the day-ahead\nto the hour-ahead market. Finally, ISO has taken steps to reduce its role as the major\npurchaser of ancillary services by allowing Scheduling Coordinators more flexibility in\nself-providing their ancillary services requirement through inter-SC trades. A major\ncomponent of the project to increase the responsiveness of the real-time BEEP stack is\naimed at increasing the speed and accuracy with which dispatch instructions are sent to\ngenerators and responded to. The other component is concerned with ex post verification\nof actual compliance with ISO technical standards for providing each of the ancillary\nservices, and confirmation that all ancillary services purchased are actually supplied.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 9 of 148\n"

Retain Price Caps for an Interim Period\n        Perhaps the single most important policy issue we address in this report is\nwhether the FERC should continue to grant the ISO the authority to impose purchase\nprice caps on its energy and ancillary services markets. Several outstanding design flaws\nidentified in our previous reports have not yet been adequately addressed, so that the\nISO's markets cannot yet be relied upon to be workably competitive. This is particularly\ntrue during hours of high ISO system load, which primarily occur in the months of July to\nSeptember. Consequently, we strongly believe that the FERC should continue to grant\nthe ISO the authority to impose purchase price caps.             Indeed, under current market\nconditions, we believe that removing the ISO’s authority to implement a purchase price\ncap would pose a significant risk in that very high prices for energy and ancillary services\ncould prevail during hours with a high ISO system load and/or high demand for a specific\nancillary service. We therefore urge the FERC to extend the ISO’s authority to impose\npurchase price caps on all ISO markets until it is clear that significant market power\ncannot be exercised in the ISO's markets. The current $750 maximum price should be\nretained at least until RMR reform is completed. The price cap should remain at this\nlevel through the end of the summer of 2000.\n                3.      Remove Regulatory Barriers to Demand Response\n        The current CTC recovery mechanism and the associated retail electricity price\nrate freeze is a major barrier to the development of the price-responsive hourly retail\ndemand necessary for a price responsive hourly wholesale demand for energy and\nancillary services. As discussed in previous MSC Reports, a price-responsive hourly\nwholesale demand is essential to limit the exercise of market power by generators during\nperiods expected to have high system loads. During periods of low system loads,\ncompetition among suppliers is usually sufficient to discipline the exercise of market\npower because a significant fraction of available generation capacity is not needed to\nmeet anticipated demand. Currently, during periods forecast to have high system loads,\nall generation unit owners know that a very large fraction of their capacity will be\nrequired to meet the ISO’s energy and ancillary services needs, regardless of the bid\nprice. With a credible price-responsive hourly wholesale demand (which is only possible\nwith a price-responsive hourly retail demand), generators bidding high prices know that\nthey stand a significant chance of not selling their capacity, even during periods predicted\nto have high system loads. For this reason, generation unit owners will bid prices closer\nto their marginal costs because they recognize that if prices are too high, the price-\nresponsive wholesale demand will decide not to purchase.\n        We show that the current CTC recovery mechanism and associated retail rate\nfreeze dulls the incentives ESPs have to install the hourly meters necessary to enable\nmeaningful hourly pricing of retail electricity. This regulatory mechanism also\neliminates virtually any financial incentive retail customers have to install their own\nhourly meters or purchase electricity according to retail rates which reward hourly price-\nresponsiveness to wholesale electricity and ancillary services prices.

[12] "prices are the three utility distribution companies (UDCs), who currently have very little\nfinancial incentive to provide hourly metering technology to their retail customers. The\nthree original IOUs also currently have significantly less ability to reduce wholesale\nenergy and ancillary services prices relative to the summer of 1998 because of the sale of\na significant amount of their in-state fossil fuel generating capacity since that time.\n        We also show that the requirement of the CTC recovery mechanism which\nprohibits forward contracting for energy and ancillary services by the utility distribution\ncompanies (UDCs) outside of PX reduces the opportunities for final demand in the\nCalifornia market to respond to high energy and ancillary services prices. Under this\nmechanism, the only market participants with a significant financial incentive to keep\nwholesale energy prices low currently have significantly less ability to do so. All other\nmarket participants are either indifferent to high wholesale energy and ancillary services\nprices (the ESPs and retail customers) or have a strong financial incentive to cause high\nprices (the new generation owners). Consequently, we believe that these incentives\nprovided by CTC recovery mechanism make a very strong case for the FERC continuing\nto grant the ISO the authority to set a purchase price cap on its energy and ancillary\nservices markets.\n        We also believe that all restrictions on IOUs entering into long-term forward\nfinancial contracts for energy and ancillary services outside of the PX should be removed.\nWe would very much like to see the PX provide these products and we applaud the\nformation of the “block forwards” market for energy. We also hope that a similar market\nfor ancillary services will be created very soon. To provide additional incentives for\nmarket participants to offer the full range of forward financial instruments that loads\ndesire, the UDCs should be permitted to enter into these forward financial contracts with\nwhomever they wish. We should emphasize that we are not advocating that UDCs no\nlonger be required to use the PX as their Scheduling Coordinator for all of their\ngeneration and load for the rate freeze period. We believe that this requirement of the\nCTC recovery mechanism substantially improves the efficiency of the California\nelectricity market during its initial stages of development by providing a transparent and\nrobust market where generators and loads can hedge their day-ahead energy\ncommitments and obligations. Because of the incentives caused by other requirements of\nthe CTC mechanism described above, this role of the PX is even more valuable during\nthe retail rate freeze period.\n        We also believe that the end of the CTC recovery mechanism for an UDC, such as\nSan Diego Gas & Electric’s announcement to end on July 1, 1999, presents a unique\nopportunity to develop the incentives for price-responsive retail demand necessary for a\ncompetitive wholesale energy and ancillary services market. A very important question\nthat must be addressed at the end of the retail rate freeze is how to determine the default\nprovider rate option for the UDC. To foster a price-responsive retail demand and\nencourage true value-added retail competition, the default provider retail rate should be\nset at the current rate freeze price less some fraction of the expected reduction in per\nMWh CTC payments by the UDC’s customers as a result of ending the rate freeze. The\ndefault provider retail rate should not be set equal to the hourly wholesale price plus the\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 11 of 148\n"

[13] "per unit transmission and distribution charges and other per unit unavoidable charges\nunless the customer already has an hourly meter installed. Charging a customer with a\nconventional meter according to this rate requires the use of load-profiling, which\ndestroys any incentive the customer has to reduce its hourly demand in response to high\nwholesale prices in that hour. For this reason, such a default provider rate locks-in a\nretail demand that does not respond to hourly wholesale price movements, while at the\nsame time virtually eliminating any profit margin for ESPs to compete for by supplying\nelectricity to retail customers. Under our suggested default provider scheme, one way\nthese retail margins can be competed away is by ESPs and the UDCs paying for the\ninstallation of hourly-metering technology. Customers on hourly meters will increase the\ncompetitiveness of the wholesale electricity market, which should result in lower average\nwholesale electricity prices to all California consumers, whether or not they have an\nhourly meter.\n                 4.     Improve FERC and CPUC Communication\n        As noted in the previous section, a price-responsive hourly wholesale demand for\nelectricity is not possible without a price-responsive hourly retail demand. This is\nperhaps the best, but by no means the only, illustration of how retail electricity market\nregulatory polices set by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) have a\ndirect impact on the efficiency of wholesale electricity markets. The CTC recovery\nmechanism described above is another important example. Wholesale markets in\nCalifornia and rest of the United States would greatly benefit from retail policies that\nimproved rather than hindered the efficiency of wholesale electricity markets.\n        Another area of state-level regulatory policy that can exert a significant impact on\nthe competitiveness of wholesale electricity markets is the process for expanding, siting\nand financing new transmission capacity. Given the increased opportunities for the\nexercise of market power during hours when there is congestion in the transmission grid,\nstate policies that are consistent with increasing the efficiency of wholesale electricity\nmarkets are crucial to the success of wholesale electricity industry re-structuring efforts.\n        Consequently, we recommend that the FERC coordinate its policies to enhance\nthe competitiveness and efficiency of wholesale electricity markets with CPUC policies\nfor the design of state-level retail electricity market policies. The ultimate goal of\nelectricity restructuring--lower delivered electricity prices for California consumers--can\nbe best achieved with greater communication and coordination between the CPUC and\nFERC along this dimension. A useful step in direction would be to organize a conference\non this topic between relevant FERC and CPUC staff and California market participants.\nThis would be an ideal forum to discuss the major issues associated moving the\nCalifornia market from one with few incentives for market-efficiency-enhancing\nbehavior, caused in part by the CTC recovery mechanism, to one which provides all\nmarket participants with the price signals necessary to market-efficiency-enhancing\ndecisions.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 12 of 148\n"

Implement Pre-Dispatch and Day-Ahead Scheduling of RMR Units\n        Our previous reports provided detailed analyses of the Reliability-Must-Run units\nand the contacts under which those units operate. The new RMR contracts, which\nbecame effective June 1, 1999, represent a significant improvement over the original\nRMR contracts that they replaced. However, the issue of when to dispatch and schedule\nRMR units under these new contracts has been point of disagreement between the ISO\nand the owners of these units. As we explain in detail below, the efficiency of California's\nenergy and ancillary services markets would be improved by dispatching RMR units\nbefore the start of the day-ahead energy market. Under this procedure, the pre-dispatched\nRMR capacity from each RMR unit would then be required to be part of a balanced day-\nahead energy schedule submitted to ISO. This change should greatly reduce or eliminate\nthe market inefficiencies caused by the attempts of RMR unit owners to use the local\nmarket power possessed by their unit during certain system load conditions to set high\nprices in the energy and ancillary services markets.\n                6.      Use PG&E Hydro Divestiture to Enhance Competition\n        The sale of PG&E’s hydro assets can hasten the end of its CTC recovery period,\nand thus potentially contribute to improved hourly price-responsiveness in the California\nmarket. However, there should be no rush to complete this divestiture unless it reduces\nconcentration in the markets to provide ancillary services and energy. We recommend\nselling PG&E’s hydro assets in watershed-size increments to entities not currently\nowning significant generation capacity in California. We much prefer a “structural”\nsolution of this type, which genuinely reduces market power, rather than a “behavioral”\nsolution consisting of various regulatory rules intended to limit the exercise of market\npower by new owner. Behavioral rules may be hard to monitor and enforce, and may\nenhance the ability of other firms, besides the one subject to the behavioral rules, to\nexercise market power. Therefore, these sorts of behavioral rules may increase market\nprices even though the firm subject to these rules never sets the market price.\n                7.      Modify the ISO's Congestion Management Procedures\n        This report also analyses the impact of the ISO’s current intra-zonal congestion\nmanagement protocols on the performance of the real-time energy market. Since the\nMarch 1999 report, intra-zonal congestion costs have dramatically risen, and the number\nof intra-zonal interfaces experiencing noticeable congestion has also risen. We suggest\nseveral market rule changes that would significantly reduce the frequency of intra-zonal\ncongestion and the mitigation costs when it does occur.\n        The ISO’s current system for managing intra-zonal congestion provides no market\nparticipant with a financial incentive to reduce intra-zonal congestion costs. However,\ndepending on load conditions and the production of nearby generation units, any\ngeneration unit owner can profit from causing intra-zonal congestion that it subsequently\nrelieves. This occurs because the ISO’s intra-zonal congestion management protocols\nallows generators located on a workably competitive side of an intra-zonal interface to be\npaid as bid to relieve the congestion. The California market rules allows unit owners to\npursue their financial interests in the real-time market. Therefore, when these firms find\nthat grid conditions are such that they can earn substantial profits from alleviating intra-\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 13 of 148\n"

[15] "zonal congestion along an intra-zonal path, this congestion tends to occur. Consequently,\nit appears that much of the current intra-zonal congestion in the California market is not\ncaused by bidding behavior of price-taking generators, but it is instead the result of\nstrategic actions of favorably located generators who understand the incentives created by\nthe ISO’s current intra-zonal congestion management protocols. We should emphasize\nthat we are not saying that these generators are violating the ISO market rules by these\nactions. These generators are simply attempting to maximize their expected profits\nsubject to the market rules they face.\n         Our solution to this market design flaw is to create a market participant with a\nstrong financial incentive to keep intra-zonal congestion costs down. As we argue, there\nis no meaningful economic distinction between energy provided to relieve intra-zonal\ncongestion from a local monopoly or duopoly supplier of this service and local grid\nreliability services provided by a local monopoly or duopoly supplier of this service.\nRMR units are designated to provide the latter but not the former service, although the\nISO tariff allows these units to be used to provide this service as well. We classify both\nof these services under the general category of “market liquidity,” because once a given\nquantity of market liquidity energy has been provided at certain points in the transmission\ngrid, it is possible to run an unconstrained zonal energy market. These market liquidity\nproviders have an incentive to alleviate intra-zonal congestion because under the terms of\ntheir RMR contract, they face the prospect of being called to relieve intra-zonal\ncongestion with incremental or decremental energy at their RMR variable payment rate.\nDuring high load conditions, when the zonal energy price is expected to be very high, the\nprospect of foregoing the zonal-market clearing price and receiving the RMR variable\npayment rate to relieve intra-zonal congestion gives the RMR unit owner a strong\nincentive to generate from its RMR units and other units to prevent intra-zonal\ncongestion. This will allow the firm to earn a high zonal price for all its capacity\nproducing imbalance energy during that hour.\n         To give the Participating Transmission Owner (PTO) the incentive to upgrade the\ntransmission grid on the paths where there is significant intra-zonal congestion, we\nrecommend charging the PTO for the costs of all RMR calls to mitigate intra-zonal\ncongestion. Currently, RMR energy used for local grid reliability services is charged to\nthe PTO, so that by charging the PTO for the costs of relieving intra-zonal congestion by\nRMR units, we are explicitly recognizing the equivalence of these two actions by RMR\nunits.\n         We also recommend that the ISO delay implementing any scheme for managing\nintra-zonal congestion in the forward market until it is convinced that the incentives to\ncause intra-zonal congestion in the real-time market have been significantly reduced.\nOtherwise it may simply end up paying twice to relieve the intra-zonal congestion along\nthe same transmission path--once in the forward market and again in the real-time\nmarket. This outcome can occur because even though day-ahead energy schedules are\nrequired to be balanced and are made feasible by a forward market intra-zonal congestion\nmeasure, a generation unit is free to deviate from this schedule and cause intra-zonal\ncongestion if this is profitable given system conditions in real-time.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 14 of 148\n"

[16] "                8.       Monitor Firm Transmission Rights (FTRs) Market\n         We remain unconvinced that Firm Transmission Rights (FTRs) sold by the ISO\nare a socially valuable “product.” First, they are designed to be primarily used to hedge\nagainst congestion charges in the day-ahead energy market, where no energy is actually\ndelivered, and not against congestion charges in the real-time market, where all energy is\ndelivered. We also do not expect any market participant to pay more for an FTR than it\ncan expect to earn in congestion revenues by owning this right. However, the ex post\ncost to another market participant besides the ISO of selling this hedge product is exactly\nequal to these congestion revenues. Consequently, one interpretation of the ISO’s sales\nof FTRs is that it is selling a product at an expected loss (the price is less than the\ncongestion revenues the FTR owner expects to receive) to hedge congestion charges in a\nmarket where no energy is actually delivered. The ISO’s FTRs also provide scheduling\npriority in the event that there are insufficient adjustment bids to clear the market on\neither side of a transmission path. However, for a large enough default usage charge\nalong a transmission path, we would expect Scheduling Coordinators to always find it in\ntheir financial interest to submit adjustment bids across the transmission path, so that the\nISO’s scheduling priority should rarely, if ever, come into play.\n         Because of the opportunities to earn profits from day-ahead inter-zonal price\ndifferences created by the existence of FTRs, one can understand why most market\nparticipants want the ISO to offer this product. However, it is unclear why requiring that\nISO offer this product enhances the efficiency of the California electricity market. If the\nISO did not offer FTRs, we would expect similar products to be offered if there were\ngenerators and loads willing to pay prices greater than or equal to the expected\ncongestion revenues they avoid by the purchase of this product. This requirement on the\nrelationship between the privately supplied FTR price and the expected congestion\nrevenues avoided is necessary for the entity offering the product to expect to earn a profit.\nIn addition, we would also expect these privately offered transmission congestion hedge\ncontracts to be based on congestion in the real-time market, when generation unit owners\nare actually supplying energy to the grid, rather than congestion in the day-ahead market\nwhich leads to only forward financial commitments to produce electricity. As the\nincident involving Path SR3 on May 25, 1999 illustrates, a SC’s day-ahead energy\nschedule along a transmission path can differ enormously from the capacity of the path3.\nThis can then lead to significantly higher zonal or statewide day-ahead energy prices and\na very high transmission charge across that path.\n         Because of the uncertain benefits to market efficiency from the ISO selling FTRs\nand the increased profit-making opportunities they allow market participants who are\nable to cause inter-zonal congestion, we strongly recommend that the ISO be able to\nmonitor the operation of this market. We also continue to believe that if certain market\nparticipants are able to obtain a large fraction of the FTR capacity on a certain\ntransmission path, they may be able to earn profits from setting extremely high\n3\n  On May 25, 1999 a day-ahead energy schedule was submitted across Path SR3, which has a capacity of\n15MW, that was more than 100 times this value.\n                          MSC

We also believe that the ability of generators to set very high congestion\nprices will be greatly diminished if position limits are imposed on their ownership.\nThese position limits would set a maximum on the fraction of available FTR capacity of a\ntransmission path that a market participant can own. We recommend that any one entity\n(including affiliates) be limited to holding no more than 40% of the available FTRs on\nany given interface.\n                  9.        Exercise Restraint in Creating New Zones5\n         When a transmission path within a zone is regularly congested, there are good\nreasons to create a new zone. This transforms an intra-zonal interface into an inter-zonal\ninterface: doing so allows congestion over this interface to be handled using market\nprocesses based on adjustment bids (as opposed to the ISO's procedures for handling\nintra-zonal congestion). However, creating a new zone can lead to highly concentrated\nownership of generation units in the markets within each zone, which enhances the ability\nof generation unit owners to set high zonal prices. In the light of this tradeoff, it is not\nthe case that creating more zones always or typically enhances the efficiency of the\noverall market. Recognizing this tradeoff, the ISO Tariff calls for the creation of new\nzones only if generation markets on both sides of the interface in question are \"workably\ncompetitive.\"\n         Below we provide a framework for assessing whether electricity markets in\ngeneral, and zonal generation markets in particular, are \"workably competitive.\" We\nthen apply this general framework and offer an empirical analysis of market outcomes\nduring 1999, which demonstrates that zonal markets do indeed allow greater\nopportunities for the exercise of market power. We find that, controlling for the level of\ntotal system load, when the ancillary services markets in California were cleared on a\nzonal basis, day-ahead prices in the SP15 congestion zone were significantly higher than\nin comparable hours, in terms of total system load, when the markets were cleared on a\nstatewide basis. In addition, we find that what we call the pivotal bidder frequency in the\nancillary services markets is significantly higher when these markets are cleared on a\nzonal basis rather than statewide. We say that a bidder is pivotal in a market during a\ngiven hour if by removing its bids from the market there are insufficient remaining bids\nto meet market demand. This implies that at least for the amount of this bid shortfall, in\nthe absence of a purchase price cap on that market, the pivotal bidder could name any bid\nprice and that would set the market price.\n         In addition, in our analysis of the ISO’s current intra-zonal congestion\nmanagement protocols we show that there are no market participants with a significant\n4\n  In May of 1998, the MSC issued an opinion on the ISO’s transmission rights proposals. At that time\nposition limits were recommended. This opinion is included as Appendix A to this report.\n5\n  Rules regarding the creation of new zones is intimately linked with procedures by which intra-zonal\ncongestion is managed and new generators can interconnect to the grid. We address both of these issues\nbelow in the section on long-term recommendations.\n                             MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 16 of 148\n"

[18] "financial incentive to reduce the incidence of intra-zonal congestion, but many with\nstrong financial incentives to cause intra-zonal congestion. Consequently, it is difficult to\nargue that the same frequency and geographic distribution of intra-zonal congestion\nwould occur if the ISO’s protocols made the existence of intra-zonal congestion costly to\nsome or all market participants. We therefore provide recommendations for revising the\nISO’s intra-zonal congestion management protocols to create incentive for market\nparticipants to reduce the incidences of intra-zonal congestion.\n         Because of the increased opportunities to exercise market power during congested\ntimes in a market with more zones, we recommend that the ISO delay the formation of\nnew congestion zones unless it needs to do so for system grid reliability reasons,. If the\ncurrent location and frequency of intra-zonal congestion continues after the revised intra-\nzonal congestion management protocols have been implemented, then creating a new\ncongestion may be the only solution. However, if these revised protocols significantly\nreduce the frequency of intra-zonal congestion in the California market, then the ISO has\nsaved itself significant increased market power risk and improved market efficiency by\navoiding the creation of a new congestion zone. It has also saved the significant software\nand administrative costs associated with creating a new congestion zone.\n         The current frequency and distribution of intra-zonal congestion illustrates\nanother important implication of the fact that the California market design allows all\ngenerators substantial freedom to pursue their financial interest in the real-time market. It\nis extremely difficult, under the California market design, to disentangle system\nreliability issues from strategic issues associated with generators pursuing their economic\ninterests. In the present context, the ISO’s current intra-zonal congestion management\nprotocols create financial incentives to create intra-zonal congestion, which can\nsignificantly compromise real-time system reliability. The ISO system operators must\noften increment and decrement significant amounts of generation capacity in real-time to\nmanage a problem that is created in large part by the economic incentives that generators\nface under the current ISO protocols for managing intra-zonal congestion.\nConsequently, the success of the California market design requires aligning as closely as\npossible the generator’s financial incentives for supplying energy in real-time with the\nISO’s desire to maintain system reliability at least cost.\n         C.      Long-Term Recommendations\n                 1.     Complete the Market Design Process\n         The ISO is currently in the process of reviewing various proposed Market\nRedesign 2000 (MR2000) Projects. These projects will continue the current ancillary\nservices and real-time energy market re-design processes. Several are particularly\npromising and should improve the efficiency of the ISO’s markets. Our highest priority\nproject proposes to provide greater integration of the ancillary services management\n(ASM) software and the inter-zonal congestion management (CONG) software. The\nbasic aim of this re-design is to allow ancillary services capacity to compete for the use of\ntransmission capacity, which should increase the depth of the ISO’s inter-zonal\n

[19] "congestion management markets. Allowing generators to have separate ramp rates for\nseveral operating levels for each ancillary service is another market change likely to\nincrease market efficiency because it increases the match between the generator’s\nfinancial commitments and the physical capabilities of the generating unit (under these\nfinancial commitments). The ability of a SC to bid and self-provide the same ancillary\nservice from the same unit during the same hour should give market participants greater\nflexibility to enter into commitments to buy and sell ancillary services. All of these\nMR2000 projects should significantly improve the operation of the ISO’s markets.\n                2.      Develop Rules Governing Entry by New Generators\n        California market does not yet have clear policy for connecting new generation\nunits to the ISO grid. On June 23, 1999, the ISO filed Amendment 19 to the ISO Tariff\nto implement a New Generation Connection Policy (NewGen) approved by the ISO\nBoard of Governors. On September 15, 1999, the FERC rejected this new generation\nconnection policy. As we discuss in Section 9 of this report, a major shortcoming of the\nISO’s NewGen policy given in Amendment 19 can be traced to the existing ISO\nprotocols for managing intra-zonal congestion. We therefore recommend that any\nNewGen policy implemented include a revision of the ISO’s intra-zonal congestion\nmanagement policy to eliminate the incentive that generation owners have to cause intra-\nzonal congestion.\n        A major focus of the ISO’s NewGen policy is how the incremental intra-zonal\ncongestion caused by a new entrant will be determined and mitigated. The new entrant\nshould only pay for the additional costs its presence in the grid imposes on other market\nparticipants, not for additional intra-zonal congestion costs that result from the incentives\ncaused by the ISO’s intra-zonal congestion management protocols. This NewGen policy\nshould also compensate new entrants for any benefits their presence provides to other\nmarket participants by netting out from these incremental intra-zonal costs any system\nbenefits it provides.\n        Besides our recommendations for revising the ISO’s intra-zonal congestion\nmanagement protocols, we also provide recommendations for the design of the ISO’s\nNewGen policy. Many of the features of the ISO’s current NewGen are consistent with\nthese recommendations, but the missing ingredient that has not been explicitly spelled out\nis the ISO’s revision to its intra-zonal congestion management policy. However, we\nshould also note that the ISO has made significant progress over the past month in\nformulating revisions to its intra-zonal congestion management protocols which appear\nlargely consistent with our recommended intra-zonal congestion management protocols.\n                3.      Eliminate Price Caps\n        The MSC remains committed to the elimination price caps on all of the ISO’s\nmarkets as soon as possible. If only to prevent market participants from testing the\nextremes of what is a tolerable maximum magnitude for a price spike, we believe that it\nwould be prudent for the ISO management and Board to maintain an extremely high\n“damage control” price cap indefinitely.

[20] "ISO markets have been corrected and the markets appear to be workably competitive,\nthere is little economic rationale even for this damage control price cap.\n                  4.     Transmission Planning\n        The current California market design provides limited incentives for grid\nupgrades and expansions. In addition, the process by which transmission capacity\nexpansion and siting decisions will occur is still the subject of some debate. This is an\narea where greater communication and coordination between the CPUC and the FERC\ncould enhance the efficiency of the California market over the long-term.\n        Grid expansions and upgrades are highly beneficial to the competitiveness of the\nCalifornia electricity market. As our empirical evidence indicates, if the energy and\nancillary services markets always cleared on a statewide basis, ancillary services prices\nwould most likely be lower. However, the grid upgrades necessary for this to occur may\nnot justify the wholesale energy price reductions that would result from completely\neliminating congestion. Nevertheless, if the lessons from deregulation in the airline\nindustry (which greatly expanded the complexity of its network following deregulation)\nare at all applicable to the electricity industry, a competitive market in generation may\nrequire a more extensive and higher-capacity network than the historical vertically\nintegrated regulated utility regime. During this regime, the vertically integrated utility\ncould substitute between additional transmission capacity and additional generation in\nways that may not be possible under the new competitive regime. Consequently, there is\ngood reason to believe that we are currently at a point where additional transmission\nupgrades at the appropriate points in the California network can significantly increase the\ncompetitiveness of the ISO’s markets.\n        Another area for further CPUC and FERC coordination is in removing any\nregulatory barriers that prevent existing transmission capacity (ETC) owners in California\nfrom joining the ISO. For this reason, the ISO’s MR2000 project proposal to provide\nnon-firm transmission rights should be undertaken. It will allow ETC holders greater\nflexibility to participate in the ISO’s markets and give the ISO market participants greater\naccess to unused transmission capacity.\n2.      Market Performance During the First Year of the ISO’s\n        Operations\n        A.        MSC Report on 1998 Market Performance\n        In its August 1998 report, the MSC conducted a review of the operation of the\nISO’s ancillary services markets and offered recommendations for improving the\nperformance of these markets. The MSC recognized at the time that more definitive\nrecommendations would have to await additional market experience and further data\nanalysis.\n                          MSC Report, October 18,

[21] "         The Committee found that the ISO’s ancillary services markets were not yet\noperating in a manner consistent with workable competition. Prices in the ancillary\nservices markets were not fluctuating in a manner that reflected changes in the underlying\nmarginal costs of supplying these products. Ancillary services markets exhibited extreme\nprice volatility, even during periods when demand was unchanged for long periods of\ntime. In the Committee’s opinion, the conditions were not yet in place to rely on these\nmarkets to set efficient, cost-reflective prices. Prices for lower quality services such as\nreplacement reserve routinely exceeded the prices for higher quality services such as\nregulation. Often ancillary services capacity prices exceeded both the Power Exchange\n(PX) and real-time energy price for the same hour, despite the fact that no net energy\nneed be produced to supply these ancillary services.6 The Committee recommended that\nuntil workable competition was established, the ISO continue to utilize a price cap for\nancillary services.\n         The Committee identified nine underlying factors that were then contributing to\nthe inefficient operation of the ISO’s ancillary services markets: (1) some firms were\nsubject to cost-based price caps while others were allowed to earn market-based rates; (2)\nthe demand for ancillary services was higher than anticipated; (3) the amount of each\nancillary service demanded by the ISO did not depend on market prices and these\ndemands were not procured in a rational manner; (4) perverse incentives for generator\nbidding and scheduling behavior were created by the RMR contracts; (5) the ISO often\npurchased ancillary services separately from small geographic areas, increasing the\npotential for the exercise of market power; (6) the ISO’s dispatch practices were not\ntransparent to market participants; (7) the allocation of ancillary services costs to\nscheduling coordinators was flawed; (8) suppliers of ancillary services from outside of\nthe ISO control area were excluded from participation in these markets; and (9) the ISO’s\ncomputer systems were still facing various software difficulties that were not yet fixed.\n         While the Committee was not able to measure precisely the relative significance\nof each of these problems, its analyses did provide some insights. The quantities of\nancillary service purchased far exceeded the levels at which they had historically been\nacquired. High demand was not a direct cause of the market irregularities, but the\nsubstantial quantities acquired appears to have increased the impact of the other factors.\nPrices for ‘inferior’ ancillary services routinely exceeded those for ‘superior’ services.\nThe ISO’s inability to substitute among these services therefore appeared to have\nsignificantly impacted the cost of acquiring them. Lastly, it appeared from the MSC’s\npreliminary analysis that RMR contracts were not doing a great deal to reduce market\npower problems. Instead, they were most likely contributing to such problems by\nproviding incentives for owners of generators with RMR units to bid and schedule their\nunits less aggressively, at higher prices than they would in the absence of these\nincentives.\n    In our March 1999 report, further review of the performance of the ISO’s ancillary\nservices markets bears out the observations made in our August report.\n6\n  Any allowable net energy supplied while providing these services is paid for at the real-time energy price.\n                           MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 20 of 148\n"

[22] "•   In the former vertically integrated regulated utility environment, the total cost of\n    ancillary services was approximately 3-5% of the total energy cost. The ISO’s\n    experience so far is that ancillary services comprise approximately 15% of the\n    monthly energy cost, although we noted that this comparison is biased in favor of\n    finding higher costs in the competitive regime.\n•   August and September 1998 prices for ancillary services continued the pattern\n    observed in the latter part of July with prices in all markets hitting the ISO’s price cap\n    of $250 on a frequent basis.\n•   Bid sufficiency analysis for July and August 1998 showed many periods of bid\n    insufficiency—values of bid sufficiency less than 100%. This was particularly true\n    during periods of peak ISO load. One striking feature of the graphs presented in the\n    report is the tremendous volatility in bid sufficiency, even throughout the day.\n        B.       August MSC Report Recommendations\n        The August 1998 MSC Report recommended to the ISO seven specific measures\nthat would, in the Committee’s judgement, enable the ISO’s ancillary services markets to\nbecome workably competitive. Those recommendations are described below.\n                 1.     Adoption of “Rational Buyer” Protocols\n        The ISO should implement “rational” purchasing practices for ancillary services\nthat allow the ISO to substitute cheaper superior services for more expensive inferior\nservices in its procurement of ancillary services.\n                 2.     Reform of Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Contracts\n        The ISO should revise RMR protocols and contracts so that these contracts no\nlonger provide incentives for generating units with RMR contracts to bid and schedule\nless aggressively (higher prices for the same bid quantity) into the day-ahead energy\nmarket and ancillary services markets. This could involve creating a new class of true\noption contracts to replace most of the RMR contracts.\n                 3.     Approval for Market-Based Rates\n        The FERC should grant market-based rates for all market participants, assuming\nthe ISO retains the authority to impose a damage control price cap.\n                 4.     Retention of a “Damage Control” Price-Cap\n        The FERC should allow the ISO to retain a damage control price-cap on all\nancillary services that can be raised or lowered at the ISO’s discretion, regardless of what\ndecision is made on granting all firms market-based rates for all ancillary services.\n                 5.     Use of a Statewide Auction for Ancillary Reserves\n        The ISO should run the auction for ancillary services on a statewide basis. If the\nstatewide market-clearing prices left a shortfall of supply in a given zone, the Committee\nrecommended using RMR contracts to make up the shortfall.\n                         MSC Report,

[23] "                   6.       Reduce the Demand for Regulation\n         The ISO should revise its scheduling and/or energy imbalance protocols to help\nreduce its need for regulation capacity.\n                   7.       Ambiguous Dispatch Practices for the Provision of Imbalance\n                            Energy\n         The ISO should establish transparent protocols for dispatching supplement energy\nbids and energy bids associated with ancillary services capacity in the real-time energy\nmarket.\n         C.        ISO Market Redesign Proposals\n         On March 1, 1999, pursuant to the Commission’s direction in its October 28th\nOrder, the ISO filed the first major set of its ancillary services market redesign\nproposals.7 These proposals included:\n                   1.       Adoption of “Rational Buyer” Protocols\n         The ISO proposed to modify its ancillary service procurement process to enable\nthe ISO to purchase additional quantities on one ancillary service that can substitute for\nanother ancillary service, in order to reduce total ancillary services purchase costs.\n                   2.       Uninstructed Deviation and Replacement Reserve Allocation\n         The ISO proposed to adjust the amounts payable to the operators of resources that\nfail to comply with ISO dispatch instructions. The ISO also put forward a plan for it to\npurchase additional quantities of Replacement reserves to cover any forecast deficiencies\nin available energy, in order to reduce the ISO's reliance on out-of-market purchases for\nthat purpose. The cost of this additional Replacement reserve capacity is allocated to\nloads in proportion to the extent that their hour-ahead energy schedules are below their\nreal-time consumption, and to generation in proportion to the extent their real-time\ngeneration falls short of their hour-ahead energy schedule. In this sense loads, are\ndeterred from scheduling less than their demands in the real-time market, and generators\nare deterred from under-producing energy relative to hour-ahead schedules.\n         A major way load protects itself from the attempts of generators to set high prices\nin the PX and ISO energy markets during peak ISO load periods, is by shifting demands\nbetween these markets and routinely scheduling significantly less energy on an hour-\nahead basis than its expects to consume in the real time market. The MSC felt that this\nscheme would increase the cost of such defensive actions by demand, thereby making\nprice spikes in PX and ISO energy markets more likely.\n7\n         On December 11, 1998, the ISO filed two other tariff changes relevant to ancillary services market\nredesign: the allocation of responsibility for ancillary services based on metered demand, rather than\nscheduled demand, and the withholding of payment for uninstructed deviations from ancillary service\ncapacity. The first of these changes, billing A/S based on metered demand was implemented on August 17,\n1999. The second change, the so-called “no-pay” provision, will most likely be implemented in February\n2000.\n                             MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 22 of 148\n"

[24] "                   3.       Automation of Dispatch Instructions for Real-Time Energy\n         The ISO described how it would automate the communication of dispatch\ninstructions to resources supplying imbalance energy in order to allow the ISO to make\nbetter use of those resources, thereby reducing its requirements for regulation service.\n(No changes to the ISO's tariff or protocols were required for this element of the redesign\npackage.)\n                   4.       Separate Pricing of Regulation Up and Regulation Down\n         The ISO proposed to introduce separate pricing for the upward and downward\ncomponents of regulation service in attempt to increase the efficiency of the regulation\nmarket.\n                   5.       Reduced Transaction Costs for Loads Participating in A/S Markets\n         The ISO proposed to develop an agreement to facilitate the participation of\ndispatchable loads in ancillary service markets. The Participating Load Agreement\n(PLA) is the load counterpart of the Participating Generator Agreement (PGA). It is a\npro forma contract to standardize load participation in the non-spin and replacement\nmarkets. (No changes to the ISO Tariff or Protocols or to ISO software were required for\nthis element of the redesign package.)\n                   6.       Trading of Ancillary Services\n         The ISO proposed certain modifications to permit Scheduling Coordinators (SCs)\nto engage in trades of ancillary services, with the intention of providing alternative means\nfor SCs to fulfill their ancillary-service obligations.8\n         In its May 26 Order, the Commission approved these six ISO’s market redesign\nproposals.\n         D.        Status of August MSC Report Recommendations\n         The Commission and the ISO have carried out, or are in the process of\nimplementing in whole or part, most of the Committee’s recommendations, as more fully\ndescribed below. However, since most of these new market design features were not\nimplemented until August 17, 1999, there is limited market experience with which to\ngauge the effectiveness of these changes. Given this limited experience, we feel it would\nbe premature to try to assess the impact these reforms have had on the overall\nperformance of the ISO markets.\n8\n         The March 1 filing also included: (1) proposed modifications to the Ancillary Services\nRequirements Protocol (“ASRP”) to reflect the ISO’s new requirements concerning communications and\ndirect control systems for units

[25] "                    1.        “Rational Buyer” Protocols\n          The ISO’s “Rational Buyer” Protocols (filed March 1, 1999 and implemented\nAugust 17, 1999) includes several features of the MSC’s rational buyer recommendation.\nWe believe that the ISO’s implementation of “Rational Buyer” represent a significant and\npositive step towards improving the performance of the ISO’s ancillary services markets.\nFundamentally, improved flexibility in the ISO’s procurement practices will tend to\nundermine any market power that suppliers of ancillary services might otherwise enjoy.\nAs mentioned in our March 25th report, there are several important features of the MSC’s\nrecommendations that were not adopted.\n          The ISO’s Rational Buyer Protocol employs different settlement procedures than\nwere recommended by the MSC in our August 1998 report. Under the ISO’s proposed\nprotocol, although the ISO indeed purchases the Rational Buyer Quantities of each\nancillary service, those ultimately paying for ancillary services, and those providing their\nown ancillary services, must only pay for or self-provide a quantity for each service equal\nto the ISO’s initial ancillary services requirements (i.e., prior to any rational-buyer\nadjustments). For example, if the ISO’s initial requirement for regulation reserve is 3% of\nthe ISO’s load, but the ISO’s Rational Buyer Protocol results in purchasing regulation\nreserve amounting to 5% of the ISO’s load, then both demanders and self-providers must\npurchase or provide regulation amounting to 3% of their load. This settlement procedure\ntends to create a subsidy to self-providers of ancillary services, because the total amount\nthe ISO pays to providers of ancillary services under this scheme will generally be less\nthan the total amount collected from purchasers of ancillary services. As a result, self-\nproviders of ancillary services will have diminished incentives to make adjustments that\nwould cause the rational-buyer prices to satisfy the inequalities that higher-quality\nancillary services sell for higher prices, which was one of the major goals of adopting a\nrational buyer protocol to begin with.\n          As discussed in our March 25th report, we recognize that both equity and\nefficiency concerns are implicated in the settlements procedure that is adopted in\nconjunction with the ISO’s Rational Buyer Protocol. We would prefer to see a settlement\nmethod that does not introduce subsidies into the system, and that conveys more accurate\nprice signals to users and self-providers of ancillary services. As a general rule, the\nCommittee is disinclined to give great weight to equity arguments based on so-called\nentitlements resulting from flaws in the market design that the ISO is in the process of\nfixing, especially if such equity considerations impede the efficient operation of the\nISO’s markets.\n                    2.        RMR Contracts\n          The Committee, and particularly its Chairman, Frank Wolak, have given\nsignificant attention to RMR issues since the August 1998 MSC Report.9 The MSC\n9\n  In December of 1998, an analysis of the impact of RMR contracts on the California energy market was\nprepared by Frank Wolak and James Bushnell for the Market Surveillance Committee. An updated version\nof this analysis is entitled, “Regulation and the Leverage of Local Market Power in the California\nElectricity Market,” University of California Energy Institute, POWER Working Paper, PWP-70, July\n1999. This report also contained a detailed set of recommendations for revision of the RMR Contracts.\n                               MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 24 of 148\n"

[26] "strongly recommended that the ISO revise RMR protocols and contracts so that these\ncontracts no longer provide incentives for generating units with RMR contracts to bid and\nschedule less aggressively into the day-ahead energy market and ancillary services\nmarkets. The MSC believes that market incentives are much improved under the new\nRMR contract settlement, implemented June 1, 1999. However, one aspect of the RMR\ncontract reforms recommended by the MSC in its March 25, 1999 report has yet to be\nimplemented. This concerns the timing of RMR calls relative to the operation of the day-\nahead energy market and the corresponding day-ahead scheduling requirements for units\ncalled to provide RMR energy.\n        Currently, RMR calls are made following the close of the day-ahead energy\nmarket. Under the scheme recommended by the MSC in its March report, RMR calls\nwould be made before day-ahead energy schedules are submitted to the ISO. Generators\nreceiving these RMR calls would have the option to elect to receive their RMR variable\npayment rate or a market determined price for supplying the RMR quantity of energy\nfrom that unit. Under this scheme, each RMR unit owner would know the amount of\nenergy that must be provided from that unit during each hour of the following day for\nlocal grid reliability reasons before it bids into the PX day-ahead energy market or\nsubmits balanced day-ahead energy schedules to the ISO. Under the MSC’s\nrecommended scheme, after the ISO determines its RMR energy requirements, all\ngeneration owners with RMR units must submit a balanced day-ahead energy schedule to\nthe ISO which has each RMR unit that it owns supplying at least the quantity of RMR\nenergy the ISO requires from that unit.\n        Even though the major RMR reforms were implemented effective June 1, 1999, a\ncomplete assessment of these reforms is constrained by data availability. The ISO’s\nsettlement data on actual metered unit-level electricity production and take-out-point\nelectricity consumption on an hourly basis is currently only available through the last\nweek of July 1999. This information is an essential input to a formal assessment of the\nperformance of the California energy market. Nevertheless, we perform analysis of the\nCalifornia energy market up through the date that we currently have data available.\n               3.      Market-Based Rates.\n        The Commission has eliminated cost-based rates for ancillary services provided\nby all market participants, and authorized market-based rates for those services. This\nstep is a prerequisite to workably competitive ancillary services markets. However, as\nthe Committee noted in its August 1998 report, the ownership and control of the PG&E\nhydro units requires particular attention. The MSC recommends that the hydro systems\nbe divested on a watershed-by-watershed basis to a buyer unaffiliated with PG&E or\nother major generation owners in Northern California.\n               4.

[27] "15, 1999. Under it’s existing authority, the ISO on October 1, 1999 increased the\npurchase price caps for ancillary services and imbalance energy from $250/MW to\n$750/MW. As discussed more fully below, the Committee strongly recommends that the\nISO retain the authority to set and change these caps, that the $750 cap be retained\nthrough the summer of 2000, and that caps thereafter be raised to the $2,500 level as soon\nas market conditions permit.\n                5.      Statewide Auction for Ancillary Services\n        The ISO has made a concerted effort over the past year to procure ancillary\nservices on a Statewide basis whenever possible. Rather than automatically splitting the\nancillary service market whenever there are significant south to north transmission\nconstraints, the ISO also considers the locational distribution of ancillary service\nresources and will run a statewide auction if it results in a acceptable combination of\nnorthern and southern resources. During the spring and summer of 1999, there have only\nbeen a few occasions where the ISO has had to procure ancillary services separately for\nnorthern and southern California. However, during the fall season, limited ancillary\nservice supplies (i.e. less hydro) and frequent south to north congestion within California\noften necessitate regional procurement. As was evident in northern California during the\nfirst week of October 1999, market power increases significantly when the market is split\non a zonal basis.\n                6.      ISO Procurement Practices\n        Two major issues that remain unresolved from the August 1998 MSC report are\nthe ISO’s procedures for procuring regulation reserve and the transparency of the ISO’s\nprocess for dispatching reserve capacity from the real-time energy bid stack. The ISO has\nimplemented several market design changes to address both of these issues. However, it\nappears that the philosophy underlying the California market design, which does not\nrequire generators to follow their net day-ahead and hour-ahead energy schedules in real\ntime, makes it difficult fully to solve these problems. This additional freedom given to\ngenerators creates greater uncertainty for the ISO about how it will meet real-time\ndemand with generation, relative to a system where energy schedules are firm physical\ncommitments to supply energy and generators face strong financial penalties for\ndeviations from these energy schedules. In addition, as discussed in our March 25th\nreport, differences in how the ISO settles “instructed” versus “uninstructed” deviations\nfrom forward energy schedules has created some undesirable, from a market efficiency\nperspective, opportunities for generators. The ISO manages this increased uncertainty by\npurchasing more regulation capacity than was used in the pre-ISO regime. This increased\nregulation capacity allows the ISO to respond instantaneously to any local energy needs\ndue to deviations by non-regulating generators from their net day-ahead and hour-ahead\nenergy schedules. However, in recent months, the ISO has been able to significantly\nreduce regulation requirements by placing a greater reliance on the real-time energy bid\nstack for managing energy imbalances, particularly during critical ramping periods.\n        In an effort to create a financial penalty for schedule deviations, the ISO, as part\nof the ISO’s Amendment 14 ancillary service market reforms, adopted a new procedure\nfor determining replacement reserve requirements and for allocating the costs of\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 26 of 148\n"

[28] "replacement reserve to SCs. Under this new procedure, in addition to the replacement\nreserve procured for other reliability purposes, there are additional replacement reserves\nrequirements that are based on the difference between the ISO’s load forecast and total\nscheduled energy with some additional adjustments for expected supplemental energy\nbids and RMR dispatch. Replacement capacity is charged to both loads and generation in\nproportion to the amount that they under-schedule in the day-ahead and hour-ahead\nmarkets. It is worth noting that this proposal will increase the costs to loads and\ngenerators from shifting their demands and supplies between the day-ahead, hour-ahead\nand real-time markets. This scheme therefore increases the cost to loads of bidding a\nprice-responsive demand into the PX and therefore substituting into the hour-ahead and\nreal-time markets if generators bid too high in the PX. The result of this implicit tax on\nload shifting may be to increase prices in both the PX and real-time energy markets.\n        As discussed in our March 25th report, another remedy is to require that\nsupplemental energy bids into the real-time energy market be submitted further in\nadvance of the actual hour they may be asked to provide energy, and to impose penalties\non generators who remove these bids in advance of the market (similar to those that are\nimposed on energy bids from winning ancillary services capacity). This remedy would\nallow the ISO to reduce its purchases of all ancillary services because the BEEP stack\ncould then be treated in much the same way as reserve capacity coming through one of\nthe ancillary services markets. Making real-time energy bids a genuine commitment for\nan extended period of time would also allow the ISO to end its current practice of\nskipping over the energy bids of units providing spin and non-spin reserve capacity.\n        Because the current market design often creates incentives for generators not to\nfollow the sum of day-ahead and hour-ahead energy schedules or 10-minute instructed\ndeviations, to some extent increased procurement of regulation may simply be one of the\ninevitable costs associated with the current market design. Because price signals are the\nonly available tool to discipline deviations by generators, these signals must be\nparticularly strong and accurate. It is impossible to use an hourly price to discipline\ndeviations within the hour that are financially beneficial to the generator. Ideally, we\nwould like prices and quantities to clear second-by-second and generators to pay for\nimbalances relative to schedules at this second-by-second price.           Clearly, such a\nsettlement scheme is beyond the range of technological feasibility. Consequently, over-\nprocurement of regulation may be a necessary to correct this mismatch between the time\nintervals over which instructed deviations are paid versus uninstructed deviations.\n3.

[29] "• During April through May of 1998, because most market participants were\n  constrained by cost-based caps for ancillary services there was very little capacity bid\n  into the ISO’s ancillary service markets. This was particularly true for the regulation\n  market which market participants perceived as a zero-net energy market, which meant\n  that they did not expect to earn much in the way of net energy payments from\n  providing regulation capacity. For all reserve services, if the capacity is called to\n  provide energy it receives the real-time price for any net energy provided. Given the\n  lack of regulation capacity being provided through the market, the ISO called on\n  RMR units to provide additional regulation. Most of the costs shown for ancillary\n  services during the ISO’s first two months of operation are payments to RMR units.\n  During the same two months in 1999, the ISO did not need to dispatch any RMR\n  units to provide ancillary services.\n• On May 21, 1998, in an effort to increase supply to the regulation market, the ISO\n  implemented a Regulation Energy Payment Adjustment (REPA). Under REPA\n  market participants received the greater of $20 or the ISO ex-post hourly imbalance\n  energy price for each MW of regulation capacity awarded. For June, 1998, RMR and\n  REPA payments constituted roughly 80% of the total monthly cost of ancillary\n  services and for July through September 1998, REPA was so effective in attracting\n  bids to the regulation market there was very little need to dispatch RMR for\n  regulation. During July through September 1998, REPA constituted roughly 50% of\n  the total monthly cost of ancillary services. On October 28, 1998, FERC approved\n  market-based rates for all providers of A/S and the REPA payment was eliminated\n  one month later. Though REPA was successful in attracting more regulation capacity\n  to the market, in retrospect, it may have been an excessive enticement during the peak\n  summer season when prices in the ISO’s imbalance market were often quite high.\n• During July through August 1998, because of transmission constraints between\n  northern and southern California, the ISO frequently ran two separate markets for\n  ancillary services, one for northern California and one for southern California. This\n  practice generally resulted in higher prices in the southern region and a greater\n  frequency of price spikes. During the same two months in 1999, the ISO rarely ran\n  two separate markets.\n• Due to software limitations, during the first five months of operation, the ISO was\n  unable to accept bids for Spinning, Non-spinning, and replacement reserves from\n  outside its control area. This changed on August 6, 1998 when the ISO began\n  accepting import bids for these three services but for reliability reasons, limited\n  spinning and non-spinning imports to 25% of the ISO’s total requirements for these\n  services.

[30] "    In April 1999, in an effort to develop a more robust hour-ahead ancillary services\nmarket, the ISO began shifting day-ahead ancillary service requirements to the hour-\nahead market. Initially, 3-5% of the day-ahead requirements were shifted to the hour-\nahead market and by mid May, this was increased to about 10%. In addition to shifting a\ncertain fixed percentage of the market requirements to the hour-ahead market, the ISO\nalso shifted additional amounts to avoid large price spikes in the day-ahead market and\nbid insufficiency. This practice reduced the overall costs of ancillary services.\n                                                                                                                                        Figure 1\n                                                                                                                   Monthly Cost of Ancillary Services\n                          $160\n                          $140                                                                                                                                                      Replacement\n                          $120                                                                                                                                                      Non-Spin Reserve\n    Million of Dollars\n                          $100                                                                                                                                                      Spin Reserve\n                                                                                                                                                                                    Regulation\n                           $80\n                           $60\n                           $40\n                           $20\n                            $0\n                                           Apr-98            May-98            Jun-98            Jul-98         Aug-98         Sep-98         Oct-98         Nov-98        Dec-98       Jan-99       Feb-99       Mar-99       Apr-99      May-99      Jun-99     Jul-99      Aug-99\n                                                                                                                                        Figure 2\n                                               Ancillary Service Costs per MWh of Load and as a Percent of Energy Cost\n                         20.00                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   40%\n                         18.00                                                                                                                                        Max Hourly Cost\n                         16.00                                                                                                                                        Avg Hourly Cost                                                                                            32%\n                         14.00                                                                                                                                        Min Hourly Cost\n                         12.00                                                                                                                                        Percent of Energy (Average)                                                                                24%\n                         10.00\n    $/M Wh\n                          8.00                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   16%\n                          6.00\n                          4.00                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   8%\n                          2.00\n                          0.00                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0%\n                                 A pr-98            May-98            Jun-98            Jul-98        A ug-98        Sep-9 8        Oct-9 8        N ov-98       D ec-98       Jan-99       Feb-99      Mar-9 9      A pr-99      May-99      Jun-99     Jul-99     A ug-99\n                         -2.00\n                         -4.00                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   -8%\n       Figure 2 shows the minimum, maximum, and average hourly ancillary services\ncost expressed in dollars per MWh of ISO actual system loads for each month of ISO\noperation.

[31] "averaged approximately $5/MWh. In contrast, for July of 1999, average hourly costs\naveraged approximately $2.40/MWh of system load and never exceeded $12/MWh of\nsystem load. August 1999 cost savings are even more dramatic. In August of 1998, the\naverage hour cost of ancillary services was $6/MWh of system load compared to\n$2/MWh for August 1999. Figure 2 also shows average ancillary service costs expressed\nas a percentage of the estimated value of ISO actual system loads. ISO actual system\nloads were valued at the PX day-ahead unconstrained market-clearing price. In May\n1998, ancillary service costs was equal to roughly 35% of the estimated value of ISO\nsystem loads, but these costs declined sharply in subsequent months. During July\nthrough August 1998, ancillary service costs were approximately 16% of total energy\ncosts. During the same period for 1999, ancillary service costs were only 6% of total\nenergy costs.\n        The negative minimum hourly cost shown for May 1999 was the result of several\nsignificant negative price spikes in the regulation market. On May 16, 1999 in hour 4\nand 5, the market-clearing price for regulation was negative $3,350.28/MW. These\nnegative spikes were caused by market participants submitting large negative bids for\nupward regulation with the apparent belief that other bids for downward regulation would\nset the market-clearing price during these hours. With this bidding strategy, market\nparticipants can gain large market shares for upward regulation while receiving a positive\nprice set by high demands for downward regulation. In these particular hours, this\nstrategy backfired as market participants collectively bid enough capacity at negative bid\nprices to cover demand for both upward and downward regulation. Effective August 18,\n1999 the ISO set separate prices for Regulation Up and Regulation Down.\n

[32] "        As mentioned above, during the summer months of 1998, price spikes occurred\nquite frequently in the A/S markets and were one of the main reasons for the high cost of\nancillary services during this period. As can be seen in Figure 3, the $250/MW cap on\nancillary service capacity was frequently hit in July through August of 1998. In August\nof 1998, the price cap was hit in more than 10% of the peak hours for spinning, non-\nspinning, and replacement reserve markets, whereas in August of 1999 the $250/MW cap\nwas hit less than 2% of the time for these same markets.\n                      B.           Ancillary Service Quantities\n        One of the main factors contributing to lower ancillary service costs is that the\nISO has made a concerted effort to lower overall requirements for ancillary services.\nFigures 4 and 5 show average hourly ancillary service requirements for August 1998 and\nAugust 1999, respectively. For August 1999, average hourly ancillary services\nrequirements declined from 1998 levels. Requirements were particularly reduced during\noff-peak hours. The services having the greatest reduction in requirements were\nregulation and replacement reserve. Figures 4 and 5 also plot that average hourly system\nloads to illustrate the pattern of loads throughout the day that are associated with these\nancillary services quantities.\n

However the reduction in average ancillary services requirements is\nproportionally greater than the reduction in average loads. While average hourly loads\nwere about 5% lower in August 1999, the average reduction in ancillary service\nrequirements was about 28%. Figures 6 and 7 express the ancillary service requirements\nfor August 1998 and August 1999, respectively, as a percent of system loads. In August\n1998, total ancillary service requirements averaged about 17% of system loads but\ndeclined to 13% in August 1999.

Specifically, is the ISO getting by with less ancillary\nservices during the summer of 1999 relative to the summer of 1999 only because of lower\nISO load during the summer of 1999? To investigate this hypothesis more formally we\nemploy linear regression techniques. This model relates the level of market-wide\nancillary services requirements for each service as of the end of the hour-ahead market to\nthe level of total ISO load as well as various dummy variables for each month from June\n1998 to August 1999. Because of the changes in ancillary services procurement policies\nthat resulted from the implementation of the Rational Buyer Protocol, we end our August\nsample at August 17, the day before Rational Buyer was implemented. This analysis will\nalso allow us to separate the impacts of better procurement practices from the old\nancillary services procurement protocols from the Rational Buyer procedure as more\nmarket data under the Rational Buyer protocol becomes available.\n                                   Define the following variables:\nREQ(i,j) = Hour-ahead ancillary services requirement for service i in hour j\nISOLOAD(j) = Total ISO load in hour j\nDAY(k,j) = An indicator variable that equals 1 if hour j is in day of week k=2,...,7\nHOUR(h,j) = An indicator variable that equals 1 if hour j is the hour of

The regression\ncoefficient on JUNE99 gives the average difference in ancillary services requirements in\nJune 1999 versus June 1998, controlling for differences in the level of total ISO load\nacross hours in the two months.

This table provides strong evidence that the reduction in ancillary\nservices requirements from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999 cannot be solely\nattributed to the lower average hourly ISO loads during the summer of 1999. Except for\nJune 1999 for Non-Spinning and Spinning Reserve, controlling for differences in total\nISO load across the two summers, average hourly ancillary services requirements in 1999\nwere significantly lower than during the same month of 1998.

[36] "          C.       Ancillary Service Prices\n          Prices in the day-ahead ancillary service market were on average much lower\ncompared to the same period last year and there were significantly fewer price spikes.\nFigures 8 and 9 show the total number of price spikes in excess of $200/MW and the\naverage hourly price for day-ahead regulation capacity for August 1998 and August\n1999, respectively. In August 1998, price spikes in the day-ahead regulation market were\nfairly prevalent during two distinct periods of the day, in the morning hours when\ndemand for downward regulation was high relative to supply and in the late evening\nhours when demand for upward regulation was high relative to supply. These demand\npatterns reflect the ISO’s use of regulation capacity to provide net energy counter to load\ngrowth during the hour. In order to meet the peak morning loads, imports on the interties\nand in-state generation begin ramping up several hours in advance. This causes an over-\ngeneration condition, which the ISO mitigates by backing down those units that provide\ndownward regulation. Similarly, in the evening hours, generation and imports on the\ninterties start ramping down several hours prior to the sharp drop in load that occurs in\nthe last few hours of the day. For these hours, an under-generation condition exists,\nwhich the ISO mitigates by ramping up the units providing upward regulation.\n          In August 1998, there were no separate requirements for upward and downward\nregulation. These two services were bought as a single product. REPA was also still in\neffect during this period. Average hourly regulation prices for this month are highly\ncorrelated with the frequency of price spikes and were highest during the evening ramp\ndown hours averaging a high of $98.50/MW in hour 22. Regulation prices were much\nmore moderate in August 1999 both in terms of the number of price spikes and the\naverage hourly price.\n          There were a number of important changes in the regulation market during this\nmonth compared to last year:\n     •    REPA was no longer in effect\n     •    For the first part of August (August 1-17), upward and downward regulation were\n          being procured separately but settled at a single price equal to the maximum of\n          the upward and downward market clearing prices10,\n     •    During the last part of August (August 18-31) upward and downward regulation\n          were settled at separate market clearing prices.\n     •    The ISO adopted a new practice of shifting some day-ahead requirements to the\n          hour-ahead market if doing so would avoid a significant price spike so long as the\n          ISO was confident that ample supplies would be available in the hour-ahead\n          market.\n     •    The ISO implemented a new algorithm for determining regulation requirements\n          that placed greater reliance on the imbalance market to follow load. This new\n10\n   At that time, software limitations prevented the ISO from settling upward and downward regulation using\nseparate prices. New software was implemented on August 18, 1999 to correct this.\n                             MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 35 of 148\n"

[38] "    Market performance improved significantly in the Spinning, Non-spinning, and\nReplacement reserve markets. In all three of these markets, the frequency of price spikes\ndropped significantly as well the average hourly prices for these products (Figures 10-\n14). As with regulation, there were several important changes that brought about\nimproved price performance for these services:\n•          ISO requirements were significantly lower, particularly for replacement reserve.\n•          On occasion some ancillary service requirements were shifted to the hour-ahead\n           market to avoid price spikes in the day-ahead market.\n•          Imports limits for Spinning and Non-spinning reserve were increased to 50% of\n           requirements.\n•          Rational Buyer was implemented in the day-ahead market on August 17, 1999 for\n           Operating Day, August 18, 1999.\nAlthough the first three changes mentioned would most likely cause ancillary service\nprices to decline, it is unclear how rational buyer would effect average prices.\n                                                                      Figure 10\n                                               Average Price and Price S pikes in the S pinning Reserve

During July through August 1998, there were 154 hours when\nISO actual system loads exceeded 38,000 MW versus 76 hours for July through August\n1999. Figures 16 to 23 provide some insight into how the ancillary service markets\nperformed under different load conditions and relative to the PX day-ahead and ISO real-\ntime energy markets. These Figures show the average prices for day-ahead ancillary\nservices, the average day-ahead unconstrained PX energy price, and the average ISO real-\ntime energy price under different load conditions for two distinct periods July to August\n1998 and July to August 1999. In a well-functioning ancillary services market, one\nwould not expect the market price of ancillary service capacity to exceed the market price\nof energy. These Figures indicate that this expectation was often violated in 1998, under\na variety of load conditions, but much less so in 1999 and generally only under high load\nconditions. These results are encouraging in that they demonstrate there is a stronger\npositive correlation between ancillary service prices, load conditions, and energy prices.\nHowever, the results also demonstrate that there still remains a tendency for prices in all\nmarkets to approach the price cap under high load conditions.\n        Figure 16 shows how regulation prices for July-August, 1998 compared to system\nloads and energy prices. Regulation prices for this month are heavily influenced by the\nRegulation Energy Payment Adjustment (REPA). Recall that during this period in\naddition to the regulation market-clearing price, participants in the regulation market also\nreceived a REPA payment equal to the greater of $20/MW or the ISO real-time price.\nThis Figure demonstrates that in hours when loads were under 31,000 MW, the\nregulation price on average exceeded both the ISO real-time energy price and the PX\nday-ahead energy price. When one factors in REPA, the effective regulation price\n(Regulation MCP + REPA payment) exceeds energy prices in almost all hours except for\n                                              MSC

For this period, REPA was no longer in\neffect and for most of the month (August 1-17), a single price was paid for both upward\nand downward regulation. The ISO began paying separate prices for downward and\nupward regulation on August 18, 1999. For hours where loads were in the range of\n18,000-27,000 MW, upward regulation prices were at or near the ISO and PX energy\nprices. For hours where loads ranged from 28,000 to 38,000 MW, upward regulation\nprices were generally lower than the ISO and PX energy prices. For hours were loads\nexceeded 38,000 MW average regulation prices were typically above the PX day-ahead\nenergy price but generally lower than the ISO real-time price. One explanation for these\nresults is that unit owners supplying regulation capacity must be compensated for the\nadditional wear and tear on their units caused by responding to dispatch signals in real-\ntime under automatic generation control (AGC). In addition, as noted above, the ISO\nuses regulation capacity to supply net energy counter to the direction of growth in system\nload during the hour. Units supplying upward regulation often must buy back energy in\nthe real-time market at high prices, and those supplying downward regulation must often\nsupply net energy during periods of very low prices.\n                                      MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 41 of 148\n"

We perform a similar regression analysis to the one\ndescribed above for the market requirement for each day-ahead ancillary service price in\neach congestion zone. Define the following two additional variables:\nPAS(c,i,j) = the market-clearing day-ahead price ancillary services i, for congestion zone\n       c, during hour j\nCONG(j) = an indicator variable that equals one if the ISO procures ancillary services on\n     a zonal basis during hour j.\nFor each congestion zone and each hour from June 1, 1998 to August 17, 1999, we\nregress PAS(c,i,j) on a constant term, a sixth order polynomial in ISOLOAD(j), a\ncomplete set of DAY, HOUR, MONTH indicator variables, the indicator variable\nCONG(j), and the three indicator variables, JUNE99, JULY99 and AUG99. The\nregression coefficient on JUNE99 gives the average difference in day-ahead ancillary\nservices prices in June 1999 versus June 1998, controlling for differences in the level of\ntotal ISO load across the two months. A similar interpretation holds for the coefficients\non JULY99 and AUG99.\n        Table 1 gives the point estimates and standard errors for the coefficients\nassociated with the indicator variables JUNE99, JULY99, and AUG99 for each of the\nancillary services. This table is consistent with the view that the reduction in average\nancillary services prices from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999 cannot be\nsolely attributed to the lower average hourly ISO loads during the summer of 1999. The\ndifference in average day-ahead prices for each ancillary service between 1999 and the\nsame month in 1998 are for the most part negative and very large relative to their\n

However, it is\nimportant to emphasis that that these results tell us less about how well the ISO’s\nancillary services markets would operate this summer if load conditions had been as high\nas they were last summer.\n        D.      Ancillary Service Bid Price and Market Price Inequalities\n        We now consider a puzzling outcome of the ancillary services market noted in\nboth the August 1998 and April 1999 MSC reports that continues to occur. The market-\nclearing price for an inferior product in terms of its technical specifications is greater than\nthe market-clearing price of a superior product in terms of its technical specifications.\nOne such example would be regulation selling for less than replacement. Regulation\nrequires that the generation unit have AGC installed. Any generation unit that can\nprovide regulation can certainly provide replacement, but opposite is not the case.\n        Table 4 shows, by month and by congestion region, the percent of times an\ninferior energy product cleared at a higher price than a superior energy product.

[48] "two percentage columns show the percent of hours an inferior ancillary service was\npriced above a superior ancillary service. For the months in which REPA was in effect,\nan effective price for regulation was used equal to the regulation market clearing price\nplus REPA. The last two columns show the percent of times an ancillary service was\npriced above either the PX day-ahead energy price or the ISO real-time imbalance prices.\nThis table shows that the frequency of price inversions for ancillary services changed\nvery little and average around 12%. However, the frequency in which the price of an\nancillary service exceeded either the PX day-ahead energy price or ISO real-time energy\nprice declined significantly after August 1998. August 1999 is separated into two periods\nas rational buyer was implemented on August 18, 1999. Though the frequency of price\ninversions increased under rational buyer, loads were much higher during the last week of\nAugust. So, it may not be appropriate to attribute this change to rational buyer. This\nresult illustrates the necessity of collecting more data on the market performance under\nthe Rational Buyer before an assessment of its full impacts on the ISO’s operations can\nbe provided.\n

[49] "        Table 5 shows the frequency (the fraction of generation unit-level bids) in which\ninvestor-owned utilities (IOUs) and new generator owners (NGO) submitted ancillary\nservice bids that violated the bid value conventions, that the bid price for regulation\nshould exceed that for spin, which should exceed that for non-spin, which should exceed\nthat for replacement. Though this occurred fairly infrequently from June 1998 to March\n1999 (averaging about 6% for both IOUs and NGOs), it increased significantly for NGOs\nbeginning in April 1999. This change is due to the bidding behavior of one particular\nNGO.\n                           E.    Bid Sufficiency\n        Figures 24-27 provide a profile of day-ahead bid sufficiency levels for each\nancillary service and for each month since the ISO began operation. These Figures\ndemonstrate that bid sufficiency improved in all markets relative to 1998 levels. The\ngreatest improvement occurred in the regulation market, which for the first two months of\noperation had bid sufficiency levels below 100% in 80% of peak hours (Figure 24).\n

These Figures demonstrate that after the ISO’s first four months of\noperation, there was, on average, an ample supply of bids relative to demand. These\nFigures also demonstrate that in recent months there has been a large share of bids in\nexcess of $25/MW compared to the same months in 1998. In the summer months of\n1998, the IOUs, who at the time were still constrained to cost-based caps for ancillary\nservices and owned more generation capacity than in 1999, were providing a large share\nof bids to the ancillary service markets. In 1999, new generator owners are providing a\nlarger share of ancillary service bids.\n                                                                                                    Figure 28\n                                                                                  Average Bid Quantitites and Prices -

The ISO Real-Time Imbalance Market\n        Supplemental energy bids comprise most of the available energy bids in the ISO\nreal-time imbalance market. The total available bids during July through August 1999\nwas down considerably from July-August 1998. The reduction in available bids is\nlargely due to lower demand in 1999 for incremental energy (Figures 35-36). Almost\nhalf of the available supplemental energy comes from outside the ISO control area\n(Figures 33-34).\n

[58] "respectively. These figures show that most of the price spikes in excess of $200/MW\noccur when system loads exceed 40,000 MW. They also show that most of the price\nspikes during July through September 1998 occurred when the ISO was incrementing\naround 1,500-3,000 MWh of energy. During July through August 1999, the price spikes\ninvolved increments of 3,000-5,000 MWh. The fact that the ISO was generally needing\nto call on larger amounts of energy when loads exceeded 40,000 MW explains to some\nextent why there was a greater frequency of prices above $200/MWh during these hours,\ncompared to 1998.\n                                                                                                                        Figure 41\n

[59] "        Figures 43 and 44 show average energy prices by load category and by the\npercent of actual load not scheduled in the forward energy markets for July through\nAugust 1998 and July through August 1999, respectively. In 1998, in hours with higher\nsystem loads, a higher percentage of these loads went unscheduled in the forward market\n(Figure 43). When loads exceeded 40,000 MW, over 6% of the actual system load went\nunscheduled. This explains why the real-time price is significantly higher than the PX\nprice during periods of high loads. This pattern of load under-scheduling during periods\nof high loads is mainly the result of IOUs hedging the risk of being exposed to a high\nprice in the PX market. By submitting price responsive demand bids to the PX market,\nIOUs are able to hedge against having to pay a high price for their entire load,\nparticularly when they do not own generation that they can bid into the PX. Even though\nload that does not clear the PX market ends up being exposed to a high price in the real-\ntime market, because it is only a small portion of the IOU’s total load, they are relatively\nbetter off.\n        Interestingly, in 1999, the pattern of load under-scheduling is much more\npronounced relative to the pattern in 1998 (Figure 44). A likely explanation for this is\nthat the IOUs own significantly less generation than they did in 1998. The generation\nthat they previously bid into the PX to serve their load is now in the hands of new owners\noperating under very different financial incentives. With less low bid-price energy\navailable in the PX, more load gets shifted to the real-time market. Note, that in high\nload periods, PX prices are generally higher that they were in 1998-reflecting the fact that\ngeneration is bidding a steeper aggregate supply curve into the PX market.\n                                                                            Figure 43\n                                                 Average Energy Prices and Percent of Actual S ystem Load Unscheduled\n                                                                          (July-August 1998)\n                                   15%                                                                                            300\n                                   13%\n                                                                                                                                  250\n                                                   % of Actual System Load not Scheduled\n                                   11%\n       A vg.

This Figure demonstrates that under normal summer load\nconditions (41,000 MW or less), there was more load hedged in the Day-Ahead PX\nmarket in 1999. However, under high load conditions (greater than 41,000 MW), there is\nless load being hedged the Day-Ahead PX market in 1999. This result supports the\nnotion that the IOUs are less able to hedge against high energy prices in 1999.\n

[61] "          G.              Recent Market Experience Under $750 Price Cap\n        The ISO’s recent experience under a new price cap of $750/MW (implemented\nOctober 1, 1999) shows that situations can arise where market participants can exercise\nmarket power and will do so to the full extent of the price cap. On October 1, 1999), the\nprimary transmission path between southern and northern California (Path 15) was de-\nrated to 900MW in the south to north direction for most hours of the day causing south to\nnorth congestion. In addition, the primary transmission path between the northwest and\nnorthern California, the California-Oregon Intertie (COI), was congested in the north to\nsouth direction. This simultaneous congestion situation meant that to alleviate congestion\non Path 15, the ISO was limited to incremental adjustment bids in northern California\n(NP15). With only a limited supply of incremental adjustment bids in northern\nCalifornia, very high adjustment bids were used and the day-ahead congestion prices\nneared $700/MWh in four hours of the day (Figure 46).\n                                                                      Figure 46\n                                    Path 15 Day Ahead South to North Total Transfer Limits and Initial

This resulted in some significant price spikes in\nthe northern California ancillary services market. In this case, one market participant\nowning generation in northern California substantially increased its capacity bids into the\nancillary services market and this change in bidding behavior resulted in a market\nclearing price for replacement reserve in excess of $300/MW for 4 hours, including a\nprice of $534/MW. Price spikes in excess of $250/MW also occurred in the Spinning and\nNon-Spinning reserve markets (Figure 48).

[64] "the ISO control area and across congestion zones. Historically market power in the\nCalifornia has been exercised to greatest extent during periods of high total ISO load.\n4.       Measuring Market Power in the California Wholesale Electricity\n         Market\n         Borenstein, Bushnell and Wolak (1999) analyze the extent of market power\nexercised in the California energy market by comparing the market-clearing price of\nwholesale energy, in this case the unconstrained PX price, to the market-clearing price\nthat would arise in a fully competitive electricity market. The competitive benchmark\nprice assumes that all generators behave as if they were unable to influence the market-\nclearing price through their bidding behavior. In this case, the market-clearing price each\nhour would equal the cost of producing an additional unit of output beyond the quantity\nof actual total ISO generation during that hour.\n         The Borenstein, Bushnell and Wolak (1999) analysis utilizes hourly metered data\non electricity produced from each generating unit in California and electricity flowing\nover each intertie into the ISO control area. In the process of constructing the\ncounterfactual competitive market price the authors make several conservative\nassumptions against finding market power. In particular, they assume that no market\npower is being exercised by in-state hydroelectric facilities in their bidding and dispatch\ndecision and by must-take facilities in their dispatch decisions. The authors also account\nfor the fact that less imports should flow into the ISO control area in response to lower\nenergy prices in California. This implies that in-state facilities would be required to\nproduce additional energy to make up the imbalance created. They make use of\nadjustment bids submitted across all interties into the ISO control area on a day-ahead\nbasis to construct the new equilibrium level of imports into the state as result competitive\npricing in California. The authors also account for weekly variation in the price of fossil\nfuels to the various in-state fossil facilities in determining the production cost for each\ngenerating unit. Using data from the National Electricity Reliability Council (NERC) on\nforced outage rates for all instate fossil facilities, the authors use Monte Carlo methods to\nintegrate out with respect to the joint outage distribution of all instate fossil facilities to\ncompute the expected fully competitive market price for each hour of the day during their\nsample period. The authors also acknowledge that some generating capacity is not\navailable to provide energy in real-time should system demand rise because it will\ncontinue to be used as system reserve. The authors assume that the amount of capacity\nprocured to provide upward regulation during each hour represents capacity that is\ndedicated to the provision of this reserve and is therefore unable to provide additional\nenergy should the need arise. As a consequence, the authors add this quantity of reserve\ncapacity to total ISO load in determining the appropriate total system demand necessary\nto compute the expected competitive price of electricity each hour.11\n11\n   Copies of the report “Measuring Market Power in California’s Restructured Wholesale Electricity\nMarket,” by Severin Borenstein, James Bushnell and Frank Wolak, which

[65] "        For the period June 1998 to November 1998, these authors estimate that the actual\ntotal costs purchasing electricity in the California market was 29% above the expected\ntotal costs that would have resulted from fully competitive pricing in the California\nmarket. This calculation does not attempt to quantify the extent of market power\nexercised in the ISO’s ancillary services market. However, the opportunity cost of\nselling capacity in the ISO’s ancillary services markets is the foregone profits the unit\nowner could have earned in the PX and ISO wholesale energy markets. Therefore, it is\nreasonable to expect that similar amounts of market power exist in these markets as well\nduring the same time period.\n        We hoped to report the results of this analysis for the period June 1999 to\nSeptember 1999 to compare to the 1998 numbers presented in Borenstein, Bushnell and\nWolak (1999). Because complete ISO settlement data, a vital input to this analysis, is\nonly available as of July 26, 1999, this was not possible. Using the available settlement\ndata, we performed this analysis for the months of December 1998 to July 26, 1999. The\nonly difference between the methodology followed in our analysis versus the one in\nBorenstein, Bushnell and Wolak (1999) is that we used $2.5/MBTU as the price of\nnatural gas for all plant locations and hours during our sample period. This was\nnecessitated by our current lack of a complete time series on natural gas prices in\nCalifornia for the sample period.\n        We compute the average hourly percentage increase in the cost of purchasing\nelectricity from the California wholesale electricity market during each month from\nDecember 1998 to July 26, 1999 relative to the pure competitive market benchmark.\nSimilar to what Borenstein, Bushnell and Wolak (1999) found for the months of October\n1998 and November 1998, the total wholesale energy cost increase above the competitive\nbenchmark for the period December 1998 to June 1998 was relatively small. It is\nimportant to remember that during these months the daily peak total ISO is significantly\nless than the daily peak in July, August and September. In addition, during the spring of\n1999 hydroelectric energy was in plentiful supply so that these unit owners were often\nfaced with the choice of spilling water or generating energy with it.\n        For the month of July 1999, first month in 1999 with a sustained period of high\ntotal ISO loads, conditions in the wholesale energy market more closely resembled those\nduring summer of 1998 rather than conditions during the winter and spring of 1999.\nAccording to our calculations, the total wholesale energy costs, excluding energy\nproduced under must-take arrangements, were 20% above those that would have resulted\nfrom the pure competitive market benchmark for the period July 1 to July 26, 1999.\nThese results illustrate that although the wholesale energy market appears to be operating\nmore efficiently in 1999 versus 1998, during periods of high total ISO load there appears\nto be a significant amount of market power exercised in the California wholesale\nelectricity market. The comparable figure for July 1998 was approximately 39%, so that\nalthough a significant amount of market power was exercised this July it is considerably\nless than the amount exercised last summer during same month. Once ISO settlement\ndata for the months of August, September and October is available, the Borenstein,\nBushnell and Wolak (1999) analysis can be repeated for entire summer of 1999.

[66] "will provide a clear answer to question of how the extent of market power exercised in\nthe wholesale energy market this summer compares to that exercised last summer.\n        To determine if the market performance in the real-time energy market last\nsummer versus this summer can be attributed to the significantly lower load conditions\nthis summer, we estimate the price regressions described above for the real-time energy\nmarket over the time period June 1, 1999 to August 17, 1999. This regression gives an\nestimate of the average hourly zonal energy price difference between the same month this\nsummer and last summer that controls for differences in total ISO load across hours this\nsummer versus last summer. Specifically, for each congestion zone and each hour from\nJune 1, 1998 to August 17, 1999, we regress REALP(c,j), the real-time price of electricity\nin hour j for congestion zone c, on a constant term, a sixth order polynomial in\nISOLOAD(j), a complete set of DAY, HOUR, MONTH indicator variables, the indicator\nvariable CONG(j), and the three indicator variables, JUNE99, JULY99 and AUG99. The\nregression coefficient on JUNE99 gives the average difference in real-time energy prices\nin June 1999 versus June 1998, controlling for differences in the level of total ISO load\nacross the two months. A similar interpretation holds for the coefficients on JULY99\nand AUG99.\n        Table 6 gives the point estimates and standard errors for the coefficients\nassociated with the indicator variables JUNE99, JULY99, and AUG99 for the real-time\nprice in NP15 and SP15. This table is consistent with the view that much of the apparent\nimprovement in the performance in the real-time energy market can be attributed to the\nlower average hourly load conditions in the summer of 1999 relative to 1998. With the\nexception of July, the average load adjusted prices in 1999 are in fact higher than they\nwere during 1998. The lower load adjusted real-time average price in July 1999 is\nconsistent with the reduced total wholesale energy costs increase due to the exercise of\nmarket power that we find in July 1999 versus that number for July 1998 reported in\nBorenstein, Bushnell and Wolak (1999).\nTable 6: Load-Adjusted Year-to-Year Difference in Real-Time Zonal Energy Prices\n                      Load-Adjusted Difference in Average Hourly Real-Time Energy\n     Month                 Prices Between Summer of 1999 and Summer of 1998\n                                  NP15                                 SP15\n                                   6.71                                 6.58\n      June\n                                 (0.99)                                (0.99)\n                                  -5.68                                -5.94\n       July\n                                 (1.09)                                (1.08)\n                                   2.16                                 3.85\n     August\n                                 (1.30)                                (1.29)\n                                        Standard Errors in Parentheses\n        The results in Tables 6, together with the evidence from the ancillary services\nmarkets, provides evidence in favor of the view that a significant portion of the apparent\nimprovement in the performance of these markets can be attributed to the milder weather\nand load conditions experienced this past summer versus last summer.

[67] "below, several important structural flaws in the California market design remain, which\nexplains why this market power remains. We then provide various recommendations for\ncorrecting these deficiencies in the market design.\n5.      Remaining Market Design Flaws and Recommendations for\n        Correcting Them\n        The ISO management and Board have worked extremely hard over the past year\nimplementing many changes in the market design that should: (1) increase the efficiency\nof the California electricity market, (2) improve the reliability of the California\ntransmission grid, and (3) lead to a sufficient quantity of new generating capacity in\nCalifornia to meet its growing electricity demand. However, several important market\ndesign issues remain unresolved from previous MSC Reports. We continue to believe\nthat they must be satisfactorily addressed before the California electricity market can\nbecome workably competitive. These issues are: (1) the timing of calls for reliability\nmust-run (RMR) units and dispatch obligations under the new RMR contracts, and (2)\neliminating the restrictions on the ability of demand to respond to high hourly wholesale\nenergy and ancillary services prices.\n        Three issues have grown in importance since the April 1999 MSC Report. They\nare: (1) the impact of market participant non-compliance with ISO dispatch instructions\nor the technical standards necessary to participate in the ISO’s energy and ancillary\nservices market on the prices in these markets and reliability of the ISO transmission\ngrid, (2) the perverse incentives for generation unit scheduling and dispatch caused by the\nISO’s intra-zonal congestion management protocols, and (3) integrating the operation of\nthe firm transmission rights (FTR) market with the ISO’s congestion management\nprotocols. The ISO management is aware of these issues and has taken significant\nactions to address them, particularly the first and third ones. It our understanding that a\nrecommended solution to this problem will be filed along with the ISO’s request for a re-\nhearing on Amendment 19, the ISO’s New Generation Interconnection Policy. Below we\nprovide our analysis of this issue and provide recommended market design changes to\naddress this problem. We also provide recommendations for integrating the market for\nFTRs into the ISO’s congestion management protocols.\n        The final set of issues concern the long-term health of the California electricity\nmarket. Given the importance of attracting new generation investment that is sufficient\nto meet California’s growing electricity demand without leading to significant excess\ncapacity in the California market (which would then lead to a period of depressed prices\nfor energy and ancillary services), these long-term market design issues become very\nimportant. First is designing the appropriate financial and local reliability obligations for\nnew generation entrants when they connect to the ISO grid so that they locate at points in\nthe transmission grid that enhance the efficiency of the market. Second is creating\nincentives for transmission capacity expansions in the ISO grid to substitute for new\ngeneration facilities, where this substitution reduces annual total delivered electricity\ncosts.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 66 of 148\n"

[68] "6.      Pre-Dispatch and Scheduling of RMR Energy in the Day-Ahead\n        Market\n        One aspect of the Reliability Must Run (RMR) contract reforms recommended by\nthe MSC in its March 25, 1999 report that has yet to be implemented concerns the timing\nof RMR calls relative to the operation of the day-ahead energy market and the\ncorresponding day-ahead scheduling requirements for units called to provide RMR\nenergy. The structure of the current RMR contracts have been revised to take the basic\nform recommended in the August 1998 Report and further elaborated on in the April\n1999 MSC Report: a fixed annual payment (independent of number RMR calls made\nwithin the year or the number start-ups that are caused by RMR calls) and a variable cost\npayment per unit of RMR energy provided. Currently, RMR calls are made following\nthe close of the day-ahead energy market.\n    We continue to remain convinced that the pre-dispatch and day-ahead scheduling of\nRMR units outlined in the April 1999 MSC report is an essential feature of the RMR\ncontract reform process. The three basic features of our recommendations are:\n1. Pre-dispatch of all RMR units before the start of the day-ahead energy market. Based\n    on its assessment of the load conditions in the California transmission grid, the ISO\n    would determine the minimum reliability energy requirements from each RMR unit.\n2. All RMR unit owners with non-zero minimum reliability energy requirements would\n    have the option to elect to receive, on an hour-by-hour basis, a PX or ISO market-\n    clearing energy price for that hour or that unit’s RMR variable payment rate for this\n    quantity of energy. This election for all hours of the following day would be made\n    before the opening of the day-ahead energy market.\n3. All RMR unit owners with non-zero minimum reliability energy requirements would\n    be required to submit to the ISO in a balanced day-ahead energy schedule a\n    generation quantity from each RMR unit that is greater than or equal to the minimum\n    reliability energy requirement from that RMR unit.\nThe benefits to market efficiency from this scheme are:\n1. It is consistent with the market design principles of the California electricity market\n    where all day-ahead and hour-ahead energy requirements are submitted to the ISO in\n    balanced schedules. The current RMR dispatch scheme requires the ISO to take\n    financial position in the real-time energy market.\n2. It would enhance the efficiency of operation of both the energy and ancillary services\n    markets. Loads would have greater certainty about when RMR energy requirements\n    are scheduled. The ISO, and therefore loads, would no longer run the risk of\n    purchasing capacity for ancillary services in the day-ahead market that cannot be used\n    because of an RMR energy need from that capacity.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 67 of 148\n"

It would delay less generation scheduling decisions to the real-time market, thereby\n    improving system and transmission grid reliability.\nBecause there do not appear to be any significant costs to market efficiency from\nimplementing this scheme, we strongly urge FERC to adopt this recommendation, given\nits many market-efficiency-enhancing properties.\n        The purpose of this section is to provide the logic underlying our\nrecommendations and conclusions about the impact of pre-dispatch and day-ahead\nscheduling of RMR energy on prices in the PX and ISO markets, as was requested by the\nFERC. To provide the necessary background for our analysis, we first summarize the\ncurrent RMR dispatch protocols. This is followed by an analysis of the impact of the\ncurrent protocols on the operation of California energy and ancillary services markets.\nWe then describe how our recommendations will improve the efficiency of the energy\nand ancillary services markets. Included in this discussion is a qualitative analysis of the\nimpact of pre-dispatch and day-ahead scheduling on prices in the PX and ISO energy\nmarkets.\n        A.     Current RMR Dispatch Procedures\n        Under the current RMR dispatch procedures, after the ISO has received a day-\nahead energy schedules for all generating units and intertie points, it determines the\nminimum necessary operating level, or Minimum Reliability Requirement (MRR), for\neach RMR unit for each hour of the following operating day. This MRR is determined\nbased on local weather conditions, forecast ISO load, and the operating conditions of\nother RMR generating units. For example, all generating units, including RMR units,\nhave a minimum operating level, below which the generating unit becomes electrically\nunstable. Consequently, the Minimum Reliability Requirement for a RMR unit can never\nbe below the minimum operating level for that unit.\n        After determining the hourly Minimum Reliability Requirement for that unit, the\nISO then compares this quantity to the final day-ahead schedule submitted by the RMR\nunit. If the final day-ahead schedule for that hour is below the Minimum Reliability\nRequirement, then that unit’s day-ahead schedule is adjusted upward to the Minimum\nReliability Requirement. The ISO implements this through a Schedule Change to the\nRMR unit owner, which gives the increase in the unit’s day-ahead energy schedule\nnecessary to guarantee that it operates at or above the minimum reliability requirement\nfor that hour. For example, if a unit schedules 20 MW into the day-ahead energy market,\nand its minimum reliability requirement is 40 MW, then a Schedule Change will be\nissued to that RMR unit for 20 MW. If the day-ahead energy schedule for that hour\nexceeds the minimum reliability requirements for that hour, then no Schedule Changes\nwill be issued during that hour for that RMR unit. For example, if a unit schedules 60\nMW into the day-ahead energy market, and its minimum reliability requirement is 40\n                       MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 68 of 148\n"

[70] "MW, then no schedule change will be issued because the unit has already included more\nthan its minimum reliability requirements in its day-ahead energy schedule. Dispatch\nnotices are issued to RMR unit owners notifying them of either the ISO’s minimum\nreliability requirement and any schedule change necessary to meet this requirement.\n         If a Schedule Change is necessary, then under the new RMR contracts (that have\nbeen in effect since June 1999), a unit owner has the option of meeting these reliability\nrequirements through either the market or contract path. Under the contract path the\nRMR unit owner agrees to operate at a level that at least meets the minimum reliability\nrequirement from that unit and receives a previously agreed upon contractual variable\ncost payment (VCP) for each MWh of RMR energy provided. Any remaining capacity\nfrom that unit may be used to supply energy or any ancillary service that unit is\ntechnically capable of providing through a market transaction.\n         The market path allows owners to schedule RMR energy in the hour-ahead\nmarket or in the real-time market. Under the hour-ahead market option, the RMR owner\nreceives the hour-ahead PX price or a bilateral transaction price that the unit owner has\nmanaged to negotiate for this RMR energy. Under the real-time market option, the\nincrement to the generator’s day-ahead schedule is treated the same way as any other\nuninstructed deviation from a unit’s final hour-ahead schedule. Under this scheme, the\nRMR unit owner is paid for this incremental energy at the real-time imbalance energy\nprice for that hour. According to the September 1999 report prepared by the ISO’s\nDepartment of Market Analysis (DMA) on pre-dispatch and scheduling of RMR energy\nin the day-ahead market12, since the new RMR contracts have been in effect, less than\n1.4% of total RMR schedule changes issued after the day-ahead market (excluding real-\ntime dispatches) have been compensated according to the market path.\n         It is important to note that under the current RMR protocols, the additional energy\nprovided under a Schedule Change through either the market or contract path is not\nmatched with a corresponding increase in load. The current RMR protocols do not\nrequire that this additional RMR energy be submitted as part of a balanced schedule.\nThis incremental energy obtained through Schedule Changes results in an excess supply\nof day-ahead energy that is unmatched with demand until the real-time market. The\nexistence of this excess supply of energy on a day-ahead basis is inconsistent with a\nfundamental design principle of the California market that day-ahead energy schedules\nshould be balanced.\n         Assume that all Scheduling Coordinators (including the PX) submitted balanced\nday-ahead schedules, and made no changes in their consumption or generation plans\nbetween the close of the day-ahead energy market and the start of the real-time market.\nUnder the current RMR protocols, the ISO would have to decrement energy from\ngenerators in the real-time market equal to the total amount of the Schedule Change\nenergy procured through RMR contract calls following the close of the day-ahead\nmarket. Consequently, the current RMR dispatch protocols require the ISO to take a\n12\n   “Pre-Dispatch and Scheduling of RMR Energy in Day-Ahead Market,” Department of Market Analysis,\nCalifornia

[71] "financial position in the real-time energy market as a result of its RMR Schedule\nChanges. This is inconsistent with another basic principle of the California market\ndesign that the ISO not take a financial position in any of the markets that it operates. All\nthe inefficiencies introduced by the current ISO RMR dispatch practices can be traced to\nthe violation of these two basic design principles.\n        B.      Market Inefficiencies Caused by a Current ISO RMR\n                Dispatch Practices\n        The current ISO RMR dispatch practices increase the volatility of real-time ISO\nand PX energy prices and artificially increases the quantity of generation in the ISO’s\nreal-time energy market. This can lead to increased ancillary services purchase costs to\nall Scheduling Coordinators and increased reliability risks for the system operator\nbecause larger discrepancies between the supply and demand for energy from SCs must\nbe balanced in the real-time energy market. As discussed above, the current RMR\ndispatch practices also result in more energy being purchased and scheduled in real-time.\nFinally, by dispatching RMR requirements after the close of the day-ahead energy\nmarket, the current RMR dispatch practices still provides the incentive for generators to\nbid the opportunity cost of their RMR variable payment rate into the day ahead energy\nmarket.\n        Although the revised RMR contracts have significantly reduced the magnitude of\nthe variable payment rate, there are still many hours when the market-clearing price in\nthe PX or real-time energy market is below the variable payment rate for many RMR\nunits. During these periods, RMR unit owners would prefer to receive the variable\npayment rate rather than the PX price or the real-time energy price for their RMR energy.\nIf the RMR unit owner’s marginal cost of production is above the expected PX or ISO\nenergy price, then it is clearly rational for the RMR unit owner not to schedule into the\nday-ahead energy market and to receive a market-clearing price below its marginal cost.\nHowever, because all RMR unit owners have non-RMR units, bidding sufficiently steep\naggregate supply curves into the PX market (so that unit owner does not win a large\nenough quantity to justify including these units in their day-ahead energy schedules to the\nISO) may be profit-maximizing. Occasionally the favorable outcome that the high-priced\nbid necessary to schedule the RMR capacity on day-ahead basis sets the market-clearing\nprice for all units owned by that RMR unit owner.\n        C.      Increased Wholesale Price Volatility and Purchased Energy\n                Costs\n        Under the current RMR dispatch protocols, if all loads submitted their anticipated\ndemand for the each hour during the following day in a balanced day-ahead energy\nschedule, the ISO would be required to decrement energy in the real-time market equal to\nthe quantity of RMR Schedule Changes issued after the close of the day-ahead energy\nmarket. We therefore expect loads to attempt to anticipate the quantity of RMR energy\nthat will called after they submit their day-ahead energy schedules. It is extremely\nunlikely that all buyers of energy will jointly be able to anticipate the precise quantity of\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 70 of 148\n"

[72] "   aggregate RMR Schedule Changes and adjust their day-ahead energy schedules\n   accordingly.\n            Any error in the forecast of aggregate RMR Schedule Changes by any load will\n   result in either too much or too little demand being shifted from the day-ahead to the\n   hour-ahead and real-time market energy markets. These RMR Schedule Change forecast\n   errors by loads will increase the price volatility in both the PX day-ahead and hour-ahead\n   markets and the ISO real-time energy markets. During some periods day-ahead PX\n   prices will be lower because loads shift too much demand to the hour-ahead and real-time\n   markets. In other periods, this price will be significantly higher because loads shift too\n   little demand to the hour-ahead and real-time markets. Because the PX supply aggregate\n   bid supply curve increases at an increasing rate and takes a reverse L-shape in both the\n   day-ahead and hour-ahead markets, this increased price volatility will result in higher\n   expected wholesale energy costs than would be the case if wholesale prices had the same\n   mean but a lower volatility. This conclusion follows because the lower prices due to an\n   unexpected small amount demand bid into the PX will tend to be only slightly lower. The\n   unexpectedly high demand bid into the PX will lead to a much higher price, because in\n   these instances the increased aggregate demand curve will now cross the very steep\n   portion of the PX aggregate supply bid curve.\n                                           Figure 51\nPrice\n                                                                           Supply\n  P2\n  P0\n  P1\n

[73] "        Figure 51 illustrates this phenomenon by plotting a representative PX aggregate\nsupply curve and three PX aggregate demand curves. The middle curve represents the\naggregate demand curve which perfectly anticipates the amount of aggregate RMR\nenergy that will called after the close of the PX day-ahead market. The market-clearing\nprice and quantity in this case are P0 and Q0. The lowest curve represents the aggregate\ndemand when too much load is shifted to the hour-ahead and real-time market. The\nmarket-clearing price and quantity in this case are P1 and Q1. The highest curve represents\nthe aggregate demand when too little load is shifted to the hour-ahead and real-time\nmarket. The market-clearing price and quantity in this case are P2 and Q2. Note that\nbecause of the very steep slope of the aggregate bid supply curve, P1 is only slightly\nbelow P0, whereas P2 is significantly larger than P0.\n        A similar result holds for the hour-ahead and real-time energy markets because\ntheir aggregate supply bid curves also resemble this reverse L-shape. Consider the case\nof the real-time market. The same logic holds for the hour-ahead market. When too\nmuch load is scheduled in markets other than the real-time market, the real-time price\nwill be slightly below the value that would occur if the all of the loads perfectly\nanticipated the aggregate quantity of RMR Schedule Changes. If too little load is\nscheduled in other markets besides the real-time market, the real-time price will\nsignificantly higher than the value that would occur if all of the loads perfectly\nanticipated the aggregate quantity of RMR Schedule Changes. By this logic, both the\nday-ahead and hour-ahead PX prices and the real-time ISO price will be more volatile\nthan would be the case if RMR energy were pre-dispatched and included in a balanced\nschedule on a day-ahead basis.\n        The more important market inefficiency is the increased expected wholesale\nenergy purchasing costs caused by the combination of the shape of the PX and real-time\nenergy supply curve and loads incorrectly forecasting how much demand to bid into PX\nand ISO energy markets. As noted above, both the PX and ISO aggregate supply bid\ncurves resemble a reverse-L shape. For simplicity we focus on the case of the day-ahead\nPX market and the ISO real-time market. Because final demand is essentially inelastic\nwith respect to the hourly wholesale price of energy, we assume that both generators and\nloads know this quantity is equal to QT. The question facing wholesale demanders is how\nto bid into the PX given that they do not know how much RMR energy will be scheduled\nbetween the close of day-ahead market and the real-time market. Suppose SPX(p) is the\naggregate bid supply curve into the PX and SISO(p) is corresponding curve for the ISO\nreal-time market. Both aggregate bid supply curves are unknown to wholesale loads at\nthe time they bid. Suppose that DMPX(p) is the aggregate demand bid curve that loads\nwould submit if they collectively knew that all RMR energy was required to be scheduled\non a day-ahead basis according to our recommendations given above. This aggregate\ndemand bid curve would result in the market-clearing price PM in both the PX and ISO\nreal-time markets. The quantity QMPX would be sold in the PX and the quantity QMISO =\nQT - QMPX in the ISO real-time market.\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 72 of 148\n"

This implies\n         that the PX price is PHPX with probability ½ and PLPX with probability ½. The ISO price\n         corresponding to PHPX is PHISO, and the ISO price corresponding to PLPX is PLISO.\n         Because of the reverse-L shape of the PX and ISO aggregate supply bid curves, PLPX is\n         only slightly below PM and PHISO is only slightly below PM. However, because the\n         market demand crosses in the steep portion of the respective aggregate supply bid curve\n         in each market, PHPX is significantly higher than PM, and PLISO is significantly higher\n         than PM. In addition, the amount of energy sold in the PX at PHPX is significantly higher\n         than the amount sold at PLPX and the amount sold in the ISO at PLISO is significantly\n         higher than the amount sold at PHISO. These two equally probable market outcomes\n         imply that loads pay expected additional energy purchase costs equal to one-half times\n         the shaded area APX minus the shaded area AISO plus one-half times the shaded area BPX\n         minus the shaded area BISO, beyond what they would pay relative to the case that that\n         they jointly know where all RMR energy will be scheduled. In the no scheduling-\n         uncertainty case they would pay PM for QT, the total quantity of ISO load.\n                 Depending on the slopes of the PX and ISO aggregate supply bid curves at the\n         price PM and the difference between two aggregate demand bid curves DLPX(p) and\n         DHPX(p), area APX can be significantly larger than area BPX and area BISO can be\n

 [75] "significantly larger than area AISO, so that total expected wholesale energy costs can be\nsignificantly higher as result current ISO dispatch practices relative to the protocol we\nrecommend where loads will jointly know that all RMR energy requirements will be\nscheduled on a day-ahead basis.\n         The Department of Market Analysis of the ISO in their September 1999 report\nfollows a different methodology to estimate that wholesale energy costs would be\napproximately 2% lower as a result of implementing pre-dispatch and mandatory day-\nahead scheduling.13 This magnitude of estimated cost savings is consistent with our\nanalysis.\n         D.       Current Dispatch Policy Encourages Under-Scheduling of\n                  Load\n         The ISO proposed a policy, which the FERC approved, to charge loads for the\nadditional Replacement reserves that the ISO procures to cover any forecast deficiencies\nin available energy in the real-time market. The cost of additional Replacement reserves\nis allocated to loads in proportion to the extent that their hour-ahead energy schedules are\nbelow their real-time consumption. As discussed above, because loads know that some\nRMR energy will show up in the real-time energy market without a corresponding load,\nthey will rationally attempt to under-schedule their energy requirements on a day-ahead\nbasis to account for this excess supply of energy due to RMR Schedule Changes.\nConsequently, the current RMR dispatch protocols and the FERC-approved policy of\ncharging loads for additional Replacement Reserves based on the amount of under-\nscheduling of demand are in direct conflict with one another. Under-scheduling by loads\non a day-ahead and hour-ahead basis is a rational response to anticipated RMR Schedule\nChanges. However, such responses will result in loads being charged for any additional\nReplacement Reserves procured by the ISO to cover this under-scheduling. These\nincreased costs will cause loads to be less likely to attempt to anticipate this additional\nafter-market supply of energy in their day-ahead energy scheduling decisions.\n         E.       Increased Reliability Risks and Increased Costs of Ancillary\n                  Services\n         Because RMR Schedule Changes supply additional energy to a balanced day-\nahead market, a larger quantity of energy imbalances must be settled in the real-time\nenergy market than would necessary if RMR units were pre-dispatched. This creates\nunnecessary reliability risks for the ISO in managing the transmission grid in real-time.\nAs noted in the DMA’s September 1999 report on the pre-dispatch of RMR units, during\nthe 17 months from April 1998 to August 1999, approximately 25% of the RMR energy\ndispatched after the day-ahead market had to be accommodated by decrementing energy\nfrom scheduled generation in real-time.

 [76] "August 1999, the DMA estimated that over 27% of the energy provided under the\ncontract path created the need to decrement other generation in real-time. In many\nregions of the ISO control area, the market for decremental energy is often extremely\nthin. As a result, the ISO is often forced to rely on out-of-market and out-of-control-area\ncalls for decremental energy. The ISO has often had to resolve over-generation\nconditions by accepting negative decremental energy bids. A negative decremental\nenergy bid implies that the generator is being paid by the ISO to not generate, whereas a\npositive decremental energy bid implies the generator is buying back the decremental\nenergy from the ISO.\n         Purchasing energy in the day-ahead market that must subsequently be bought\nback in the real-time market even at a positive price, also increases wholesale energy\nprocurement costs to loads because generators are willing to be decremented only at price\nsignificantly less than the day-ahead price of energy. To the extent that these\ndecremental bids are accepted out-of-sequence in the real-time energy market, the costs\nto loads from the ISO accepting these decremental bids will not be reflected in a lower\nzonal energy price but in higher intra-zonal congestion costs.\n         The process of scheduling additional energy in the form of RMR Schedule\nChanges after the close of the day-ahead market and then decrementing energy in real-\ntime results in a significantly less efficient and more expensive generation dispatch\nprocess. This process also involves greater grid reliability risks relative to an RMR\ndispatch procedure which pre-dispatches RMR generation before running the day-ahead\nenergy market. In order to guard against the increased reliability risks caused by the\ncurrent RMR dispatch protocols, the ISO may need to purchase a greater quantity of\nquick-response ancillary services such as Regulation. By purchasing a greater quantity of\nthis ancillary service, the ISO can expect to pay a higher price. This increased price is\nthen multiplied by the greater demand, resulting in higher ancillary services costs than\nwould be occur under a scheme involving pre-dispatch of RMR units.\n         Under the current RMR dispatch protocols, Schedule Changes are issued after\nday-ahead energy schedules have been finalized and the day-ahead ancillary services\nmarket has been cleared. Because of this sequencing, the ISO must sometimes buy back\nancillary services commitments won by RMR units in the day-ahead ancillary services\nmarket so that the generating unit can meet an RMR Schedule Change for energy.\nUnder current RMR dispatch protocols, the RMR unit owner is paid for the ancillary\nservices that it wins in the day-ahead market as well as for the additional energy it\nprovides under the terms of its RMR contract. Consequently, under the current ISO\nprotocols, an RMR unit owner can be paid for providing both energy and ancillary\nservices from the same increment of generating capacity in the same hour, despite the\nfact the ISO has purchased ancillary services capacity in hour-ahead market to substitute\nfor this unavailable capacity from the RMR unit. During periods when the ISO purchases\nunusable day-ahead ancillary services capacity, it is purchasing more total ancillary\nservices capacity than it would need if RMR energy was pre-dispatched in a balanced\nday-ahead energy schedule. By purchasing an excess amount of ancillary services\ncapacity, the ISO further increases ancillary services prices and total costs.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 75 of

 [77] "        During the summer of 1999, the procurement of day-ahead ancillary services\ncapacity that cannot actually be used because it is required to provide RMR energy has\nbecome increasingly frequent, further increasing the ancillary services costs associated\nwith current RMR dispatch protocols.\n        F.       Increased Energy Prices Due to RMR Variable Payment Rate\n        Even though the RMR variable payment rates have been significantly reduced\nrelative to the levels in the original type A RMR Contracts, for many generators, their\ncurrent RMR variable payment rates is often above the market-clearing PX price or real-\ntime energy price. Therefore, during hours when the PX price is expected to be below\nthe unit’s RMR variable payment rate, we would expect the opportunity cost of supplying\nRMR energy at the variable payment rate to be the binding lower bound on the price at\nwhich the unit owner will bid that capacity into the PX. This follows from the same logic\ngiven in the April 1999 MSC Report for the bidding behavior of a generator under a type\nA RMR Contract. An RMR unit owner would bid this capacity into the PX at a price that\nyields at least the same expected profits that it could obtain from providing energy at the\nvariable payment rate under the terms of its RMR contract. Consequently, we would\nexpect that generators bidding the opportunity cost of their RMR units into the PX market\nto result in higher market-clearing PX and ISO energy prices.\n        Because a very small number of the variable payment rates are above $100/MWh,\nnone are above $500/MWh, and the vast majority are below $50/MWh, the impact of\nRMR unit owners bidding the opportunity cost of their RMR variable payment rate into\nthe PX and ISO energy markets is likely to be substantially less than under the old type A\nRMR contracts. As a result, the unweighted average PX and ISO hourly electricity prices\nmay be somewhat higher than those that would result from the pre-dispatch of RMR\nenergy. However, as discussed above the volatility of the PX and ISO electricity prices is\nlikely to be significantly greater and total purchased energy costs (or equivalently, the\nquantity-weighted average price) higher for the reasons discussed above and in the\nDMA’s September 1999 report on the pre-dispatch of RMR units. In addition, total\nancillary services demand and costs are also likely to be noticeably higher as result of\ncurrent RMR dispatch practices relative to the case of pre-dispatch of RMR energy in a\nbalanced day-ahead energy schedule.\n        G.       Recommended RMR Dispatch Protocols with New RMR\n                 Contracts\n        The guiding principles of the California market design provide a clear\nrecommendation for designing RMR dispatch protocols that eliminate the market\ndistortions and increased costs associated with the current RMR dispatch protocols\ndescribed above. This is the recommendation given in the April 1999 MSC to pre-\ndispatch RMR capacity before the start of the day-ahead energy market and require all\npre-dispatched RMR requirements to be submitted as part of a balanced day-ahead\nenergy schedule. While more complex schemes have been proposed by the DMA in its\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 76 of 148\n"

 [78] "September 1999 report, there are three features that should be a part of any protocol that\nis adopted.\n1. Pre-Dispatch of RMR Units. The ISO would determine all energy RMR\nrequirements for all hours of the following day before the start of the day-ahead energy\nmarket. We refer to this as pre-dispatch of RMR units. Under this scheme, the ISO\nwould determine the RMR energy requirements from all RMR units and make this unit-\nspecific information available to all market participants before the start of the day-ahead\nenergy market.\n2. Pre-Declare Market or Contract Payment Option. After learning the quantity of\nRMR energy requirements for all RMR units for all hours of the following day, each\nRMR unit owner would have the option to declare for each hour of the following day\nwhether it would like to receive the market price of energy or the RMR contract variable\npayment rate for RMR energy supplied from that unit. The RMR unit owner electing the\nmarket option for a given hour, would have the option of electing to be paid the zonal PX\nday-ahead price, zonal PX hour-ahead price, or ISO real-time zonal price for that hour for\nthe congestion zone that contains their generating unit for energy supplied under the\nterms of the RMR contract.\n3. Unit-Level RMR Energy Must Be Included in a Balanced Day-Ahead Schedule.\nAll RMR units with non-zero RMR energy requirements must have their unit-level RMR\ngeneration obligations included in a balanced day-ahead energy schedule submitted to the\nISO. This requirement places no restrictions on how the unit owner must bid its RMR\ncapacity into day-ahead or hour-ahead PX markets or the ISO real-time energy market.\nIf the RMR unit owner elects the market path for its payment for RMR energy, then the\nunit owner should be able to hedge its RMR energy obligations in any manner it sees fit.\nThe unit owner could bid this capacity into the PX day-ahead or hour-ahead market, or\nthe ISO real-time market. The unit owner could also arrange to hedge this quantity of\nenergy through a bilateral contract. However, it is important to emphasize that no matter\nhow the unit owner constructs a financial hedge for the pre-dispatched energy from its\nRMR units, it must submit a balanced day-ahead energy schedule to the ISO with a total\nquantity of generation from each RMR unit exceeding its pre-dispatch RMR energy\nobligations.\n        To order to clarify how this protocol would work, consider the following\nexample. Suppose a market participant owned two RMR units. At 5 am the day before\nthe actual quantity of electricity would be delivered, the ISO would notify this market\nparticipant of the Reliability Requirement from both of its RMR units. Suppose that the\ncapacity of each unit was 250 MW and that for the hour in question the ISO determined\nthat 100 MW was the Reliability Requirement for each unit. This information and the\nReliability Requirements for all RMR units would be made available all market\nparticipants. All RMR unit owners would then have one hour to notify the ISO which\nhours in the following day they would like to receive the market price (and what market\nprice for energy they would like to receive) and what hours they would like to receive the\nvariable payment rate. Thus, by 6 am, one hour before final bids must be submitted to\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 77 of 148\n"

 [79] "the PX day-ahead market, all RMR unit owners would complete their election of how\nthey would like to be compensated for providing the quantity of RMR energy required\nfrom each RMR unit.\n         Following the close of the day-ahead energy market, the RMR unit owner is\nrequired to submit a balanced energy schedule to the ISO for the hour in question that\nincludes at least 100 MW of generation, the Reliability Requirement for that hour, from\neach of the RMR units. It is the responsibility of the RMR unit owner to procure the load\nnecessary to submit a balanced day-ahead energy schedule. One option is to bid the\nquantity of pre-dispatched RMR energy into the PX day-ahead market or hour-ahead\nmarket at a price of zero to guarantee that this generation is balanced against an\nequivalent demand. Another alternative is for the RMR unit owner to sell this energy to a\nthird-party under a bilateral contract. The final alternative is for the RMR unit owner to\nbalance the total unit-specific RMR generation that it must provide in its day-ahead\nenergy schedule with a fictional load. In this case, the unit owner is simply selling this\ngeneration in the real-time energy market.\n         H.      Impact of Pre-dispatch and                         Mandatory          Day-Ahead\n                 Scheduling of Energy Prices\n         The most likely outcome from implementing the above recommendations is a\nnoticeable reduction in total wholesale energy purchase costs from the day-ahead and\nhour-ahead PX energy markets and the real-time ISO energy market. Another benefit\nshould be less energy price volatility because of a reduction in the frequency of price\nspikes in the day-ahead, hour-ahead or real-time energy markets when an unexpectedly\nhigh level of demand is purchased in the day-ahead, hour-ahead or real-time energy\nmarket as discussed above. The constraints a generation unit owner faces when it\nattempts to maximize expected profits by its bids into the day-ahead energy market\njustify the view that these changes in RMR dispatch protocols do not artificially depress\nenergy prices in the PX and ISO markets.\n         The logic for this view goes as follows. Because the maximum amount of total\nRMR energy requirements in any hour rarely exceeds 4,000 MW, and most often is in the\nneighborhood of 1,500 MW, only a small fraction of the capacity of any single generator\nis producing energy under an RMR contract. Consequently, the length of a market\nparticipant’s bid curve that may be bid at a zero price in the PX because of the pre-\ndispatch of RMR energy, is likely to be very small relative to the total capacity a\ngeneration owner would bid into the PX or submit to the ISO in its day-ahead energy\nschedule.\n         In Wolak (1999), optimal bidding strategies for a firm participating in a bid-\nbased-dispatch electricity market are derived.14 Wolak shows that a generation owner’s\noptimal strategy is constrained by the residual demand curve that it faces.

 [80] "demand curve is the difference between the aggregate demand bid curve for energy in the\nmarket and the aggregate supply bid curve of all firms besides the firm bidding. If SO(p)\nis the aggregate supply bid curve of all market participants besides the firm under\nconsideration and D(p) is aggregate market demand bid curve for energy, then the\nresidual demand curve faced by the firm is DR(p) = D(p) – SO(p). If S(p) is the firm’s\naggregate supply bid curve, the market-clearing price is determined from the intersection\nof the firm’s residual demand curve with its aggregate supply bid curve, or equivalently\nthe price, p*, that solves the equation DR(p*) = S(p*). The residual demand curve faced\nby the generation owner depends both on an aggregate demand bid curve and the\naggregate supply bid curves of all other firms in the market, both of which are unknown\nat the time this firm submits its aggregate supply bid curve. This implies that the residual\ndemand curve faced by the firm can be thought of as stochastic at the time a generation\nunit owner submits it bids. Consequently, unit owners submit supply bid functions which\nattempt to cross each possible residual demand curve it might face during that hour at a\nprice that maximizes the firm's profits for that residual demand curve. This optimal\nbidding strategy can be used study the impact of the proposed RMR dispatch protocols on\nmarket-clearing prices in the PX and ISO energy markets.\n         Figure 53 graphs the aggregate demand bid curve, the aggregate supply bid curve\nof all other market participants and the resulting residual demand curve faced by the firm,\nDR(p), and a candidate bid curve for the firm, S(p), which passes through the profit-\nmaximizing market-clearing price associated with that residual demand curve. As\ndiscussed in Wolak (1999), at the time the unit owner submits its bid into the energy\nmarket, neither the value of SO(p) nor the value of D(p) is known. Consequently, the\ngenerator must set the bid supply curve, S(p), so that it maximizes the generation unit\nowner’s expected profits over all possible realizations of DR(p). However, if the\ngenerator were able to predict the realization of the DR(p), then a bid curve through the\npoint (PM,QF) would maximize its profits from bidding into this market.\n         By taking the smallest possible residual demand curve that a generator might face\nand computing the profit maximizing price and quantity associated with that residual\ndemand curve yields the end point of the determinant portion of the profit-maximizing\nbid function. Figure 54 plots the highest possible residual demand curve and the\nassociated marginal revenue curve and the lowest possible residual demand curve and the\nassociated marginal revenue curve. The figure also plots the firm’s marginal cost curve.\nOn each residual demand curve the best response price and quantity are noted. Any bid\ncurve that is upward sloping from the origin to the point (Ps,QS) would yield the same\nlevel of expected profits to the firm, because a residual demand curve will never cross\nthis generator’s bid curve at a point to the southeast of the point (Ps,QS) in Figure 54. A\nzero price and positive quantity segment of the bid curve that is of length less than QS\nwill yield the same expected profits to the firm as an aggregate supply bid curve that is\nsteadily increasing from the origin to the point (Ps,QS). If QS is greater than the pre-\ndispatch RMR quantity allocated to the firm, then mandatory submission of the quantity\nof RMR energy in a balanced day-ahead schedule will not affect the firm’s expected\nprofit-maximizing bidding behavior into PX day-ahead energy market.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 79 of 148\n"

 [82] "         Only if the value of QS in any hour is below the quantity of RMR energy pre-\ndispatched will the recommended RMR dispatch protocols be likely to affect generator\nbidding behavior. There are two additional factors which make it unlikely that QS in a\ngiven hour is less than the quantity of RMR energy required to be supplied by an RMR\nunit owner. First, during the hours in which residual demand faced by the first is likely\nto be particularly small (in the neighborhood of DS given in Figure 54), total ISO load is\nlikely to be small and therefore the transmission grid is not likely to be stressed. In this\ncase a very small quantity of aggregate RMR energy will be required. This in turn\nimplies that even a small value of QS for a specific generation owner will be larger than\nits total RMR energy requirements for that hour. Second, during periods when total ISO\nload is high, the total quantity of energy needed from all generation owners is likely to be\nsubstantial so that the value of QS in these hours is likely to be very high. This implies\nthat a substantial quantity of RMR energy will still be less than QS, implying that the\nrecommended RMR dispatch protocols are likely to have little impact on generator bids\nduring periods with both low and high total ISO system loads.\n         Only if unit owners withhold significant amounts of their generation capacity\nfrom the PX day-ahead market by bidding most of their capacity at high prices in attempt\nto raise market prices in the PX, should this constraint have any impact on generation unit\nowner bids into the PX. We should note that this is precisely the sort of behavior the pre-\ndispatch and a mandatory day-ahead scheduling requirement is attempting to eliminate.\nConsequently, the we do not believe that implementing these recommendations will\nartificially depress PX or ISO energy prices, only eliminate the incentives generators\nhave to exploit their ownership of RMR units to raise market prices.\n         Besides a lowering wholesale energy price volatility and a reducing total\nwholesale energy purchase costs, the other significant benefit of pre-dispatch and\nmandatory submission of a balanced day-ahead schedule containing the unit-specific\nRMR requirements is that the ISO will no longer need to decrement generation in real-\ntime to make room for RMR energy not submitted in a balanced day-ahead schedule.\nBecause units scheduled to provide RMR energy on a day-ahead basis can only supply\nancillary services from unused capacity, this scheme also eliminates the need to\ndecrement ancillary services quantities won in the day-ahead market to allow RMR\nenergy to be supplied from that generating facility.\n         This scheme is also consistent with the ISO’s current policy of charging for\nadditional replacement reserve in proportion to the amount that a load under-schedules its\ndemand on an hour-ahead basis relative to its real-time consumption. Because all pre-\ndispatched RMR energy must be submitted as part of a balanced day-ahead schedule,\nthere will no longer be excess energy appearing in the real-time market as a result of\nRMR Schedule Changes which loads must account for in their day-ahead and hour-ahead\nenergy schedules. Consequently, loads will no longer have an incentive to under-\nschedule in anticipation of this incremental RMR energy in the real-time market.\nBecause all market participants know the unit specific RMR energy to be supplied in a\nbalanced day-ahead schedule from each RMR unit before they submit their bids into to\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 81 of 148\n"

 [83] "PX day-ahead energy market there is no uncertainty about when and from what units that\nRMR energy will produced. This greater certainly about the timing and location of the\nsupply of RMR energy will give loads greater confidence about which markets they\nshould bid their demand into. This will reduce the volatility of prices in both PX day-\nahead and hour-ahead energy markets and the ISO real-time energy market.\n        Finally, the greater certainty about the timing and location of the supply of RMR\nenergy will delay less grid management and generation dispatch activities to the real-time\nmarket and therefore reduce the reliability risk associated with RMR dispatch, which\nshould reduce the ISO’s demand for quick-response ancillary services capacity. This\nshould reduce the price the ISO must pay for these ancillary services, as well as total\nancillary services costs.\n7.      Regulatory Impediments to a Price-Responsive Demand for\n        Energy and Ancillary Services\n        Often regulatory policies designed to solve one market design problem can create\nsignificant market distortions. The stranded asset recovery mechanism, known in\nCalifornia as the Competition Transition Charge (CTC) is an excellent example of this\nphenomenon. The current CTC mechanism creates several impediments to involving\nprice-responsive demand in the day-ahead, hour-ahead and real-time energy markets,\nthereby significantly decreasing the competitiveness of the California electricity market.\nThe market distortions created by the CTC mechanism provide a strong argument in\nfavor of the continued imposition of damage control price caps on all ISO energy and\nancillary services markets until the CTC recovery period ends or some of its major\nmarket distortions are corrected.\n        There are two aspects of the stranded asset recovery process that creates these\nmarket inefficiencies. First is the retail rate freeze and the associated CTC recovery\nmechanism. The second is prohibition against any forward financial contracting outside\nof the PX markets for generation owned by any of the three investor-owned utilities\n(IOUs) in California or load served by the utility distribution companies (UDCs) owned\nby any of the three (IOUs). The separation of wholesale market and retail market\nregulatory oversight in California between FERC and the California Public Utilities\nCommission (CPUC) also creates an additional impediment to increasing the\ncompetitiveness of the California electricity market. We show that certain current CPUC\npolicies significantly dull, if not eliminate, the incentive retail customers have to respond\nto hourly energy and ancillary services prices, thus rendering the California wholesale\nmarket less competitive, particularly during high load periods. This section points out\nthese structural problems with the current design of the California market and suggests\nseveral remedies.\n        The major flaws with the current market design are:\n1. The CTC recovery mechanism eliminates virtually all incentives for the vast majority\nof final loads to be price-responsive with respect to hourly wholesale electricity prices.\n

 [84] "2. The only market participants with a financial incentive to take actions to lower\nwholesale electricity prices in any single hour are the IOUs. They achieve a higher CTC\nrecovery rate during hours when energy and ancillary service prices are lower.\nCompetitive energy service providers (ESPs) receive no financial benefit from lower\nhourly wholesale prices during the rate freeze period.\n3. Under the retail rate freeze incentives, the only way for the IOUs to make it attractive\nfor their retail customers to reduce hourly demand in response to high hourly wholesale\nelectricity and ancillary services prices is to pay them to reduce demand. This alternative\nis not financially viable for the ESPs, because they receive do not receive CTC payments.\n4. The prohibition on forward contracting by UDC load outside of the PX limits the\navenues for price-responsiveness available to loads in the California market. This leads\nto higher wholesale prices than would be the case if loads could hedge their electricity\nand ancillary services consumption further in advance of its delivery.\n5. Prohibition of forward contracting by UDCs for ancillary services beyond day-ahead\nmarket unnecessarily forces ISO to take a financial position in the day-ahead and hour-\nahead ancillary services market as buyer of ancillary services requirements for PX load.\n6. Lack of coordination between retail competition policy and wholesale competition\npolicy can lead to market failures in either or both markets. The extent of the price-\nresponsiveness of hourly wholesale demand is determined by the extent that there is a\nprice-responsive hourly retail demand.\n         Although all of these distortions can be traced directly or indirectly to the CTC\nrecovery mechanism, they will not automatically be eliminated when the CTC recovery\nperiod ends. Steps should be taken as soon as possible to eliminate these distortions. We\nmake several recommendations in the regard.\n1. Maintain ISO authority to set maximum purchases prices in energy and ancillary\nservices markets until the CTC recovery period ends.\n2. Eliminate all prohibitions on forward contracting by UDCs outside of PX for energy\nand ancillary services.\n3. When rate freeze ends for a UDC, do not implement a default provider retail rate\nwhich passes through hourly wholesale electricity purchase costs. This locks-in a lack of\nhourly price responsiveness in retail demand with detrimental consequences for\ncompetitiveness of wholesale electricity markets.\n4. Instead, when rate freeze periods for a UDC, require it to offer a default provider rate\nto equal original rate freeze retail or some fraction of rate freeze rate (to account for\nelimination of CTC recovery). All UDCs must offer this new rate to all of its customers.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 83 of 148\n"

 [85] "5. After rate freeze period, allow both UDCs and ESPs to offer any bundle services and\nprices in order to create full diversity retail valued-added services. Retail competition\nwith UDC required to offer default provide rate described in point 4 will lead to de facto\nwholesale pass-through tariff it this is desired by customers. This policy should also lead\nto full range of value-added metering and load monitoring service tariffs customers\ndesire.\n6. The FERC and CPUC should attempt to coordinate policies to foster price-responsive\nhourly demand in a cost-effective manner. California retail and wholesale markets are\nhighly inter-related.\n        A.      CTC Mechanism Eliminates Incentives for Final Load to Be\n                Price Responsive\n        Under the current rate freeze in California, the retail electricity rates are frozen at\ntheir 1996 level less 10%. Define PR as this fixed retail price. Under the current CTC\nrecovery mechanism, generally speaking, this fixed retail price can be broken down into\nthe following components: PR = PE + T&D + CTC + RES, were PE is a weighted\naverage of the various California electricity and ancillary services prices (principally the\nPX price), T&D is the price of transmission and distribution services, CTC is the\ncompetition transition charge, and RES is a residual category charge which pays for a\nvariety items such as demand-side management programs and the rate reduction bonds.\nAn important implication of this equation is that the CTC component is defined so that it\nholds on a monthly basis. Electricity is sold to the final consumer at the price PR.. This\nenergy is purchased from PX and ISO markets, and transmission and distribution charges\nare paid at the rate T&D and the residual category payments are made at the rate RES,\nand any money left over goes to the CTC payment. This means that the difference\nbetween monthly retail revenues and the monthly amounts paid for wholesale electricity,\ntransmission and distribution, and the residual expenses category yields the monthly\namount of CTC recovery.\n        Because retail rates are fixed and final demand is a function of this fixed retail\nprice, the total revenue collected from customers on these frozen retail rates is\nindependent of movements in wholesale electricity prices. Therefore, total retail\nrevenues for the state of California collected from customers on these frozen rates is\nessentially independent of hourly wholesale electricity prices for energy and ancillary\nservices. Because CTC payments are defined as the difference between monthly retail\nrevenues and the monthly amounts paid for wholesale electricity, transmission and\ndistribution, and the residual expenses category, the investor-owned utilities (IOUs) have\na strong incentive to keep electricity prices low during the rate freeze period. Other\nwholesale generation market participants must earn all of their revenues from energy and\nancillary services sales in the PX and ISO markets. They are not entitled to receive any\nCTC payments. For this reason, these generation owners prefer high energy and ancillary\nservices. During the rate freeze period, there is a fixed amount of retail revenues\navailable in the California market that does not depend on the actions of wholesale\n                        MSC Report,

 [86] "market participants to influence hourly energy or ancillary services prices. Investor-\nowned utilities receive a larger share of this revenue pool through their CTC payments if\nenergy and ancillary services prices are low. Other generation unit owners receive a\nlarger share if energy and ancillary services prices are higher through direct payments for\nwholesale energy. CTC payments to the IOUs fall by the same amount that revenues\nreceived by the other generation owners increase as result of higher wholesale energy and\nancillary services prices, because the total amount received by all market participants\nmust equal the fixed (with respect to the actions of market participants in the wholesale\nmarket) pool of retail revenues.\n         Because ESPs, compete with the incumbent UDC in supplying retail electricity to\nfinal customers, it is important to understand their incentives during the rate freeze. In\norder to provide retail electricity, an ESP must produce electricity or purchase wholesale\nelectricity from the PX and ISO energy markets. It must purchase transmission and\ndistribution services, as well as pay RES and CTC per unit of electricity delivered to final\nretail customers. To the ESP, the CTC charge is simply a cost of doing business in the\nretail market. The ESP receives no benefit from lower energy prices because the ESP’s\ntotal CTC payments rises to exactly compensate for these lower energy prices on a\nmonthly basis. The only electricity retailers with a financial incentive to take actions to\nlower wholesale electricity prices are the UDCs, because their parent companies will\nreceive larger CTC payments during the months in which wholesale energy prices are\nlow. The ESPs on the other hand, receive no direct financial benefit from lower\nwholesale electricity prices.\n         The combination of the CTC recovery mechanism and the retail rate freeze\nimplies that it is unprofitable or economically irrational for an ESP to supply electricity at\na retail price is below PR. Suppose the ESP sold electricity at a retail price PR* that is\nless than the retail rate freeze price PR. Because the ESP must still pay the same values\nof T&D, RES, and CTC that the UDC must pay for delivering the same amount of\nelectricity to the final customer, the ESP is effectively selling wholesale electricity to the\nfinal customer at a price below PE. However, the ESP must buy its wholesale electricity\nfrom the PX and ISO markets if it does not own any generation. If it does own\ngeneration, the opportunity cost of it selling electricity produced from its generating units\nis the wholesale electricity price in the PX and ISO markets. Consequently, by selling\nretail electricity at a price below the rate freeze price, the ESP is selling wholesale\nelectricity at an average price below what it can be sold at in the PX and ISO markets.\n         This aspect of the CTC recovery mechanism and retail rate freeze explains why\nsuch a small number of residential customers have switched electricity suppliers.\nAccording to the latest California Energy Commission (CEC) figures through May of\n1999, slightly more than 1% of customers of the 3 UDCs—San Diego Gas and Electric,\nSouthern California Edison, and Pacific Gas and Electric—have switched electricity\nsuppliers since the start of the California electricity market.\n         Besides giving little incentive for retail consumers to switch from the incumbent\nUDC to a competitive ESP, the current CTC recovery mechanism and retail price freeze\n                          MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 85 of 148\n"

 [87] "also provides little incentive for customers to install real-time metering technology and\npurchase their electricity according to the hourly PX or ISO price. The customer must\ncontinue to pay T&D, RES, and a CTC payment, that increases when wholesale energy\nprices are low and decreases when wholesale energy prices are high, no matter what\ncompany supplies the retail electricity. This implies that a customer electing to purchase\nretail electricity according to some weighted-average hourly wholesale price of electricity\nshould receive little, if any, cost savings from this decision. In addition, either the\ncustomer or the energy supplier (who then must recover this cost from the customer) will\nhave to pay the cost of installing real-time metering technology on customer’s premises.\nConsequently, during the CTC recovery period virtually all retail customers have no\nincentive to install the metering technology necessary to purchase electricity according to\nthe hourly wholesale price.\n         As discussed above, the UDC would like its retail customers to reduce their\ndemand during hours when ISO load is expected to be high in order to reduce wholesale\nprices and increase its rate of CTC recovery. However, the option of a frozen retail price\nand the CTC payment mechanism gives retail customers no incentive to reduce their\ndemands during these time periods. Consequently, all demand reduction mechanisms\nproposed by the UDCs have involved payments to customers for reducing their demand\nduring periods when the wholesale price is expected to be high. In this way the UDC\nshares with the retail consumer the increased CTC revenues that it receives as a result of\nlower wholesale prices.\n         Even though the UDC would like its customers to reduce their demand in periods\nof high ISO load, it has very little incentive to switch these customers to a real-time\nmeter. A customer with a real-time meter can compute precisely how much it is costing\nthe UDC to supply electricity using their hourly electricity consumption and the hourly\nwholesale prices of energy and ancillary services. This customer will be more likely to\nswitch suppliers following the end of the rate freeze period if the UDC’s retail price is not\nas low as the one the customer can obtain from an alternative supplier. By installing a\nreal-time meter on a customer’s premises, the UDC creates a far more sophisticated\ncustomer who has the ability to respond to hourly price signals and can be billed based on\nhis consumption during each hour of the day. A customer whose meter is read on a\nmonthly basis can only be charged based on some function of his total monthly\nconsumption. Consequently, the set of pricing schemes that can be devised to compete\nfor customers with hourly meters are much more sophisticated than the pricing schemes\nthat need to be devised to compete for customers whose meters can only be read on a\nmonthly basis.\n         If a significant number of customers had hourly meters, ESPs and the UDCs\nwould then be able to compete to offer many different types of pricing structures to\nmatch the heterogeneity in the willingness of customers to respond to real-time price\nsignals. We would expect some customers to want to face the hourly price of electricity\nand therefore face the full risk of hourly wholesale price spikes and also receive the full\nbenefits of very low wholesale prices in their month electricity bill. Some customers may\nonly want to hedge against the upside risk of hourly wholesale price spikes and therefore\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 86 of 148\n"

 [88] "pay more for consumption during hours when wholesale prices are low. Despite the\nlarge potential benefits to both retail and wholesale competition from the widespread\nimplementation of hourly meters, because the incumbent UDCs currently have only\nslightly less than 99% of their original customers, they have little financial incentive to\npay to create more sophisticated customers who they must then compete more vigorously\nto retain.\n        Because ESPs do not receive CTC payments, they cannot offer a payment scheme\nfor demand reduction during periods expected to have high wholesale prices. An ESP\nmay wish to install a real-time meter to offer a customer rate package that is superior to\nwhat the customer currently receives from the UDC. However, the current CTC recovery\nmechanism and availability of service from the UDC at the rate-freeze retail price makes\nit very unlikely that a rate package that causes the customer to switch will be profitable\nfor the ESP. Consequently, the combination of the CTC recovery mechanism and the\nretail rate freeze severely limits the opportunities for retail competition and, more\nimportant, the incentives for the installation of real-time metering technology to increase\nthe amount of final demand that is price responsive on an hourly basis.\n        B.      Prohibition Against UDC Contracting Outside of PX Forces\n                Forward Sales of Energy and Ancillary Services to Day-\n                Ahead Market\n        The prohibition under the CTC recovery mechanism against UDCs forward\ncontracting for any of their load outside of the PX markets further limits the ability of\nloads to be price responsive over longer time horizons than a day ahead-basis. This\nforward contracting prohibition on UDCs requires the vast majority of total ISO system\nload to the hedged on a day-ahead basis. An average of over 80% of total ISO load is\nhedged through the PX energy markets. This implies that over 80% of wholesale energy\npurchase commitments are being hedged on a day-ahead or hour-ahead basis, and\napproximately half of the remaining quantity of total ISO load is purchased at the real-\ntime ISO price. The remaining energy consumed is produced by non-UDC generators\nand sold through bilateral contracts.\n        This prohibition on forward contracting outside of the PX unnecessarily forces\nloads to hedge their forward energy requirements with no more advance notice than a\nday-ahead basis. While the recently introduced PX block forwards market for energy is\ntremendous step in the right direction, loads still need more opportunities to be price-\nresponsive with a longer lead-time that the day before delivery of energy takes place.\n        These limitations on forward contracting reduce the competitiveness of the\nCalifornia energy market. Most of the UDC’s load is known with a very high degree of\ncertainty far in advance of the day before the electricity is actually delivered to final\ncustomers, and for this reason the UDC would therefore prefer to have the option to\nhedge its load further in advance.

 [89] "far in advance of the delivery date, a UDC unnecessarily gives up any advantage it has\nbecause of its superior information about the nature of its final demands in the near\nfuture. In a market with unrestricted forward contracting, the UDC would be able to\nexploit this superior information to obtain more attractive energy prices when signing\nforward financial commitments with generators. In a market which allows many\ndifferent avenues for forward financial contracting far in advance of delivery, loads\nwould negotiate larger forward financial commitments with generation owners during\nhours when they expect their demand for electricity to be unusually high. If UDCs have\nsome discretion as to when unexpected load increases can occur they may move them to\nthose periods when they are able sign particularly attractive forward hedge contracts.\nOnce these forward financial commitments are signed, generation owners holding the\nother side of the hedge contract will find it in their financial interest to bid more\naggressively in the day-ahead, hour-ahead and real-time energy markets. As shown in\nWolak (1999), these forward contracts commit generation unit owners to compete\naggressively to supply at least their forward financial positions made in the day-ahead,\nhour-ahead or real-time energy markets.15\n         On a day-ahead basis, UDCs have very limited opportunities to reduce their\npurchases of wholesale electricity. However, on a day-ahead basis it is very easy for a\ngeneration unit to reduce its supply of electricity. It simply shuts down. Therefore, on a\nday-ahead basis the threat of generation owners not supply into the market is far more\ncredible than the threat of loads not to purchase from the market. Consequently, during\nhours forecast to have a high total ISO demand, loads must purchase energy and ancillary\nservices on a day-ahead basis at very high prices. A year or even a month before the\nhour or hours under consideration, a load can plan in advance not to consume if it expects\nto pay very high prices. With enough advance notice, a load can commit not to consume\nelectricity for a significant period of time at a fairly low cost. The shorter the time lag,\nthe more costly it is for loads to reduce their demand for electricity and ancillary services.\nGiving loads more advance notice reduces the asymmetry in the bargaining position\nbetween generation owners and loads that occurs on day-ahead basis. Loads should\ntherefore be able purchase forward commitments for energy and ancillary services on\nmore favorable terms far in advance of delivery than on a day-ahead basis as is required\nduring the CTC recovery period. By restricting the forward contracting activities on the\npart of the UDCs, the ability of the new generation owners in the ISO control area to\nexercise market power in the day-ahead and hour-ahead energy and ancillary services\nmarkets is unnecessarily enhanced.\n         This asymmetric treatment of UDC load and generation relative to that of the new\ngeneration owners (NGOs) (who are not prohibited from forward contracting outside of\nthe PX market) unnecessarily handicaps UDCs in their attempts to limit the exercise of\nmarket power by the NGOs.

 [90] "day-ahead market to hedge their energy purchases and contract for their associated\nancillary services requirements. In the markets for most all products, consumers are\nallowed to benefit through lower prices by their ability to intelligently plan ahead for\nunforeseen market contingencies through their advance-purchasing decisions. The\nCalifornia market design prohibits UDCs and their retail customers from realizing many\nof these benefits from advance planning, even although the NGOs are able to contract to\nsell or purchase energy far in advance of the actual delivery date, in any manner they see\nfit and with any other market participant.\n        The prohibition on forward contracting outside of the PX also forces the ISO to\ntake an unnecessarily active role in the ancillary services market as the agent to purchase\nall ancillary services requirements for the PX on a day-ahead or hour-ahead basis. Under\ncurrent ISO rules all scheduling coordinators, including the PX, have the opportunity to\nself-procure their ancillary services requirements. The PX currently does not run a\nforward ancillary services market on behalf of their customers through which they could\nself-procure their own ancillary services requirements. For example, the PX could offer\nto pay all of the market participants whose capacity did not win in PX a some fraction of\nthe PX price for the right to use this capacity to meet some or all of its ancillary services\nrequirements. Rather than simply notifying the ISO of its day-ahead energy schedule and\nallowing the ISO to serve as its agent in purchasing ancillary services from the day-ahead\nand hour-ahead ancillary services markets, PX could become an active participant in\nancillary services markets.\n        This prohibition also puts the ISO in the uncomfortable position of needing to be\na strategic player in the ancillary services markets or face the prospect of extremely high\nprices in this market. Because total ISO load is largely exogenous to wholesale energy\nprices, the total hourly demand for ancillary services capacity is, for the most part,\nperfectly price inelastic. The ISO’s Rational Buyer algorithm has introduced price-\nresponsiveness for each ancillary service individually, but the total quantity of capacity\ndemanded is still inelastically demanded. Consequently, the ISO must take actions\nthrough its purchasing behavior in the day-ahead and hour-ahead markets to limit the\nability of other market participants to exercise market power in these markets.\nOtherwise, very high prices would occur in these markets during periods of high demand.\nBy eliminating the prohibition on forward contracting outside of the PX for ancillary\nservices and energy, the ISO would no longer need to be placed in this position. All\nloads in the ISO market would have the opportunity to self-procure their ancillary\nrequirements through long-term bilateral negotiations, forward financial contracts-for-\ndifferences linked to the day-ahead ancillary services price, or through inter-SC trades. If\na load did not like the forward contract for ancillary services that it had, it could switch to\nanother supplier whose terms it liked better. Under this scheme the ISO could be\neffectively eliminated from the process of ancillary services procurement. The ISO’s\nancillary services markets would simply become day-ahead and hour-ahead imbalance\nmarkets for ancillary services were market participants can buy or sell incremental\nancillary services

 [91] "         We would still expect occasional price spikes in these incremental ancillary\nservices markets because of temporary capacity shortages and the associated scarcity\nvalue of generating assets. These should also continue to occur in the real-time energy\nmarket, as they do in all spot markets. However, it is important to note that under this\nforward contracting scheme, loads would only have to pay these very high prices for the\nincremental demand for ancillary services beyond the quantities they contracted for in\nadvance of the day-ahead or hour-ahead market, not for their entire ancillary services\ncapacity, as is the case under the current prohibition on forward contracting for ancillary\nservices outside of the PX.\n         As evidence that both generators and loads would prefer to hedge significantly\nless energy on a day-ahead basis than occurs under current CTC recovery mechanism, we\nnote that less than 20% of total annual electricity sales in the Nordic Power Exchange\n(Nordpool) are hedged through the day-ahead market.16 The Nordpool has been in\nexistence for almost ten years and has grown from initially serving just Norway to now\ninclude Sweden, Finland and Denmark, yet the annual fraction of energy hedged on a\nday-ahead basis has never been more than 20% of total annual sales. The vast majority\nof transactions on this market are arranged according to long-term contracts signed far in\nadvance of the day before the energy is delivered. This fact provides evidence consistent\nwith the view that the efficiency of the California energy and ancillary services markets\nwould be significantly enhanced if the prohibition on UDC forward contracting outside of\nthe PX was eliminated.\n         In closing, we would like to emphasize that we do not recommend that the current\nrequirement under the CTC mechanism that all UDCs use the PX as their scheduling\ncoordinator be eliminated. Particularly during the initial stages of the California market\nwhen many design flaws remain and others are yet to be discovered, the PX provides the\nextremely valuable service of providing a transparent and deep day-ahead market for\nenergy. Throughout the CTC recovery period, with the resulting market efficiencies that\nit creates, this very important role of the PX seems more than worth the potential\nproductive inefficiencies that may arise because of the PX’s statutory monopoly in\nproviding Scheduling Coordinator services to the UDCs for their load and generation.\n         C.       Separate Regulation of Wholesale and Retail Competition\n                  Can Harm Both Markets\n         In the United States, FERC regulates wholesale electricity supply and the state\npublic utilities commissions regulate retail electricity supply. As the above discussion\nhas illustrated in the restructured electricity industry in California, these two activities are\nhighly inter-related. A retail competition policy that does not foster the development of a\nprice-responsive hourly final retail demand will not result in a price-responsive hourly\nwholesale electricity demand. As has been discussed in the previous two MSC reports, a\n16\n   See Wolak, F.A., “Market Design and the Behavior of Prices in Restructured Electricity Markets: An\nInternational Comparison,” (1998),

 [92] "price-response hourly wholesale electricity demand will significantly enhance the\ncompetitiveness of the California electricity market. However, as described above, many\nof the retail competition policies and stranded-asset recovery policies enacted at the state\nlevel are contrary to the goal of a price-response hourly wholesale electricity demand.\n        One example of such a policy is the CPUC decision to allow a direct access\ncustomers to switch from the UDC to an ESP without installing an hourly meter. Instead,\nthis customer is billed according to a representative load profile which effectively\nallocates the customer’s total monthly electricity consumption to all of the hours during\nthe month. These allocated hourly consumption amounts are then multiplied by a\nweighted-average hourly wholesale price to arrive at the customer’s estimated hourly cost\nand these are added together over all hours to yield that customer’s monthly bill for\nenergy. However, as is well known, a customer whose monthly bill is determined\naccording to a representative load profile receives the same cost savings from a 1 KWh\nreduction in consumption during an hour when the PX price is $700/MWh as he does for\nby 1 KWh reduction in an hour when the PX price is $0/MWh. Even in a world without\nthe CTC recovery mechanism, a customer billed according to a load profile has little\nincentive to substitute consumption away from hours in the month when PX or real-time\nISO prices are extremely high. This customer only has an incentive to reduce total\nmonthly consumption during months when the average wholesale energy prices are high.\nHowever, he will most likely do this during hours that when it is cost for him to reduce\ndemand in rather than hours when the PX or ISO price is extremely high, as would be\nrequired to have a price-responsive hourly retail demand. By allowing retail competition\nwith load profiling, virtually all of the financial incentives have been eliminated for any\nmarket participant to foster the formation of a price-responsive hourly final demand for\nelectricity vital for a workably competitive wholesale market during high ISO load\nperiods.\n        Without a retail market that has a large fraction of final demand facing an hourly\nprice for each unit of consumption during that hour that is tied directly to the wholesale\nprice of electricity during that hour, it is impossible for electricity suppliers to credibly\nbid into the day-ahead and real-time markets to reduce their demand in response to high\nwholesale prices. Currently, the UDCs and other market participants bid price-\nresponsive demands into the PX day-ahead and hour-ahead markets. However, all\nmarket participants know that the vast majority of these demand-side bids are not\ncredible commitments to reduce final demand in response to high prices. They\nunderstand that because all but a very small fraction of final customers in California\npurchase electricity at fixed retail prices, final UDC demand does not depend on the\nvalue of the hourly PX or ISO energy price. Therefore, any UDC load obligations that\nare not hedged in the PX day-ahead or hour-ahead markets must be purchased at the real-\ntime ISO price. Consequently, as noted in Section 3, during high periods of high ISO\nload, generation unit owners are able to set extremely high prices, with the only limit\nbeing the ISO’s purchase price cap.\n        Without coordination between the CPUC and FERC to foster a price-responsive\nhourly final demand for electricity, it will be extremely difficult to develop a price-\n                         MSC

 [93] "responsive wholesale electricity demand to mitigate against the exercise of market power\nand reduce the frequency of extremely high wholesale electricity price spikes during\nperiods of high ISO load.\n         D.       Limiting Market Inefficiencies Caused by CTC Recovery\n                  Mechanism\n         The most direct way to eliminate the market inefficiencies caused by this\nmechanism is to end the rate freeze. As discussed above, because of the incentives\ncreated by the CTC recovery mechanism, very few final customers have an incentive to\nalter their hourly demand in response to high hourly wholesale prices. Therefore,\nthroughout of the rate freeze period, virtually all final customers are indifferent\nmovements in hourly wholesale energy and ancillary services prices. During this period,\nall generation owners (except the UDCs) prefer high hourly wholesale energy and\nancillary services prices. Only UDCs would prefer low wholesale electricity prices to\nincrease the amount of CTC payments they receive. However, none of the three UDCs\nbesides Pacific Gas and Electric own a significant quantity of flexible generation capacity\n(non-must-take capacity) to exert a substantial influence on wholesale energy or ancillary\nservices prices. Even Pacific Gas and Electric’s flexibility is severely limited during\ncertain times of the year because the most of its non-must-take capacity is hydroelectric.\nConsequently, for the remainder of the rate freeze, the economic agents with the greatest\nability to limit hourly wholesale prices—final customers—have virtually no incentive to\ndo so, and the only agents with any incentive to limit hourly wholesale prices have a very\nlittle ability to do so relative to the first year of the market, when all three UDCs owned a\nsignificantly larger quantity of flexible generation capacity.           All remaining market\nparticipants have strong incentives to take actions to set high wholesale prices.\n                  1.      Necessity of Maximum Purchase Price Caps During Rate Freeze\n         Other mechanisms must therefore be put in place in order to more quickly end the\nrate freeze period and the reduce the amount of time the market must tolerate the market\ninefficiencies described above. One such mechanism is a price-cap on the ISO’s real-\ntime energy market and the ancillary services markets. Because the retail price paid\nduring the rate freeze and CTC recovery period is fixed for the vast majority of\ncustomers, when total ISO load is high to due to hot weather or other factors, energy and\nancillary services prices can get extremely high. Generation unit owners know that even\nextremely high prices will be met with little, if any, reduction in total ISO load and\nancillary services demand. The only limit on the market-clearing prices during days of\nvery high total ISO load is the purchase price cap, which is frequently hit during several\nhours of the day in the real-time energy market and in several of the ancillary services\nmarkets.\n         If the authority of the ISO to set and adjust this purchase price cap is removed, it\nis unclear how high prices will go in these markets during the very high ISO load periods.\nThe non-UDC generation unit owners understand the very limited incentives final\ndemand has to respond to hourly prices during the rate freeze period and the

 [94] "ability the UDCs have to limit price spikes with their available generation capacity. They\nshould therefore correctly perceive that it is very unlikely that extremely high prices bid\ninto the real-time energy and ancillary services market will result in significantly less of\ntheir generation capacity being sold in these markets. Therefore, during the high total\nISO load days, there would be virtually no limit, besides ISO software constraints (which\ncan accept enormous bid prices) on how high a price might be set in the energy market or\nin any ancillary services market. The only way these high prices may cause final\nconsumers to reduce their demand is when wholesale prices are so high, for so many\nhours during the month, that total monthly CTC payments are in fact negative. This\nwould occur if the difference between monthly retail revenues and the sum of monthly\nwholesales energy costs, transmission and distribution costs, and the residual category\nexpenses is negative. Consequently, one very strong justification for the continued\nimposition of the ISO’s purchase price cap is the CTC cost recovery mechanism and\nassociated retail rate freeze. Until the incentives against developing retail competition\nand price-responsive hourly demand caused by the CTC mechanism are eliminated, ISO\nenergy and ancillary services markets without a purchase price cap are at risk for periods\nof enormous wholesale energy and ancillary services prices. These periods of high prices\nwill further delay the end of the rate freeze because CTC payments will comprise a\nsmaller fraction of monthly California retail electricity revenues, which lengthens the\ntime until the retail competition and a price-responsive final demand becomes a\nsignificant part of the California electricity industry.\n         Because of the potential for very high energy and ancillary prices without a\npurchase price cap during the rate freeze regime and the fact that frequent high prices will\ndelay the end of the rate freeze, a prudent policy would be to allow the ISO to continue\nhave the authority to set a maximum purchase price cap on the energy and ancillary\nservices markets. The logic presented above also argues in favor of a price cap that is\nshaded downward relative to the level of a “damage control” price cap, in order to speed-\nup the CTC recovery rate and shorten the length of time the California electricity market\nmust tolerate the market inefficiencies caused the CTC recovery mechanism. The very\nlimited incentive final demand has to respond to hourly wholesale energy and ancillary\nservices prices implies that whether the purchase price cap is set at $250/MWh or\n$750/MWh it will most likely be hit during the same the hours during the month.\nGeneration unit owners have a very good idea of what system load conditions allow them\nto hit the price cap. These load conditions are virtually independent of the level of the\nprice cap given the limited amount of price-responsive hourly final demand in the\nCalifornia market.\n                2.      Policies to Improve Efficiency of ISO Markets After End of Rate\n                        Freeze\n         The CPUC should prepare for the end of the retail rate freeze for all UDCs by\nputting in place policies that promote the form of retail competition necessary to increase\nthe competitiveness of the wholesale electricity market. There are three major policies\nthat should be put in place as soon as possible. The first is to end the prohibition on\nforward contracting outside the PX for all UDCs. The second is the elimination of any\ncost-based cap on retail electricity prices in the service area of any UDC that ends its rate\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 93 of

 [95] "freeze.17 The third is the elimination of any regulated revenue recovery for electricity\nmeter installation, reading and repair for any UDC as soon as it ends its retail rate freeze.\n         The design of the California electricity market anticipates that the PX will face\ndirect competition from other scheduling coordinators once the rate freeze ends.\nHowever, for the reasons cited above, we believe it is prudent to continue the requirement\nthat all UDCs use the PX as their SC until the rate freeze ends for all UDCs. Continuing\nthe prohibition on forward contracting outside of the PX unnecessarily perpetuates the\nmarket inefficiencies described above. We believe that all prohibitions on forward\nfinancial contracting outside of the PX should end.\n         The end of the retail rate freeze is a very important event in the process of\nfostering meaningful competition for electricity supply and metering services. Recall the\nequation described above relating the rate freeze retail price to the CTC:\n                                           PR = PE + T&D + CTC + RES.\nAt the end of the rate freeze, the CTC component of this equation is set equal zero.\nBecause monthly the CTC contribution has been positive for all months since start-up of\nthe California market, there is an opportunity for significant price reductions as result of\nthe end of the rate freeze for customers in that UDC’s service area. However, as noted\nearlier, the availability of real-time metering technology and other information systems\nnecessary for final demand to become a more sophisticated participant in the California\nmarket is currently very limited and likely to stay so for remainder of the rate freeze\nperiod for the reasons described above.\n         However, policies can be put in place at the end of the rate freeze to provide\nmaximal incentives for final demand to become an active market participant, so that the\nfull benefits of retail and wholesale competition can be realized by all California\nconsumers. To this end, we recommend retail competition policies that will create the\nopportunities for the kinds of retail competition necessary for a workably competition\nwholesale electricity market. This policies should also increase the likelihood that\nvibrant retail competition will occur as rapidly as possible following the end of the rate\nfreeze period.\n         Two keys features of this retail competition policy are: (1) rely on competition\nwherever possible to limit retail prices, and (2) where output price caps are deemed\nnecessary to protect the UDC’s less sophisticated existing customers, do not set these\ncaps based on the UDC’s cost of production. By allowing competition rather than\nexplicit price regulation to limit retail prices, ESPs and the UDC have the maximal\nincentive to offer the full diversity of products and services consumers demand. One of\nthe anticipated benefits of retail competition is that it will create incentives for innovative\nways to provide electricity and other services in bundles that provide tangible benefits to\n17\n   This proposed policy change is particularly relevant for San Diego Gas and Electric, which announced\nthe end of its rate freeze effective July 1, 1999.\n                              MSC

 [96] "retail customers. In order protect consumers who may be initially unwilling or\napprehensive about becoming active participants in the retail electricity market, we\nrecognize the necessity of a regulated default provider rate. However, for all of the\nreasons that cost-of-service regulation was abandoned in favor of competition, we believe\nthat this default provider rate should not be set based on the UDCs costs, but using a\nrevenue cap approach. Directly passing through wholesale energy and ancillary services\ncosts in a default provider rate significantly dulls the incentives for the retail competition\nto occur or result in the sort of final demand necessary for a workably competitive\nwholesale market. Fortunately, because of the structure of the CTC mechanism, the rate\nfreeze price can easily be used as a starting point for a revenue cap approach to setting\nthe default provider rate.\n         Therefore, we recommend that following the end of its rate freeze, the UDC be\nrequired to offer the rate freeze retail price or some fraction of this retail price to all\ncustomers as a default option. Otherwise, there should be no cap on the prices the UDC\nis allowed to charge its retail customers besides this requirement that the UDC continue\nto offer this modified rate freeze tariff option as the default provider rate. This modified\nrate freeze rate could be determined by taking the total amount of CTC dollars paid over\npast year by that UDC’s customers divided by the total amount electricity sold to these\ncustomers. Call this the average CTC recovery rate, CTCA. Some fraction of CTCA,\nsay 50%, could then be subtracted from the original rate freeze price to determine the\nnew default provider rate (DPR). Under this scheme, the DRP would be approximately\nanother 10% below the rate freeze average price. Customers that choose not to switch to\nan alternative ESP or to different tariff structure with the UDC should be able to purchase\ntheir electric according to the DPR.\n         There should be no restrictions on the other tariffs the UDC is allowed offer, or\nthe tariffs that other ESPs offer. Specifically, the UDC should be allowed to offer a tariff\nwith average prices for electricity above the DPR. Unless this tariff involves the\nprovision of additional value-added services that a customer values highly, we would not\nexpect a customer to choose this tariff over the DPR. Tariffs that do not deliver\nconsumer benefits will not exist for long. First, any ESP has the option to undercut the\nrate offered by the UDC and provide the same or superior services, if the UDC is making\nexcessive profits from certain tariff. Second, if the consumer is not receiving any benefit\nfrom these the supposed value-added services bundled with a new tariff, he can always\nelect to purchase electricity under the DPR. A higher priced tariff can only survive\nbecause the UDC or ESP offers a bundle products and services that the customer finds\nsuperior to the DPR.\n         The UDC should also have the opportunity to offer tariffs with average prices\nbelow the DPR. Clearly, this option also exists for ESPs. It is certainly possible to do so\nbecause the UDC and other ESPs in that service area no longer have to pay the CTC\ncharge per unit of electricity delivered to final customers. We would expect that\ncompetition among the ESPs and the UDC to provide bares-bones retail electricity would\ndrive average prices to something approximating the average wholesale price of\nelectricity plus T&D and the RES expenses.

 [97] "prices set by the UDC (besides the requirement to offer the DPR) creates the possibility\nof a retail margin from serving some classes of customers during the initial period\nfollowing the end of the rate freeze. A retail margin is necessary to justify many of the\nup-front investments necessary for new and existing retail competitors to provide value-\nadded retail services such as hourly metering and real-time load-monitoring information\nsystems to final customers.\n        Mandating that the UDC offer a default provider rate that passes through a\nweighted average of the hourly wholesale energy and ancillary services prices using\nrepresentative load-profiles eliminates the incentive for the development of these value-\nadded services. This in turn, eliminates any opportunities for the price-responsive hourly\nfinal demand necessary for a price-responsive hourly wholesale electricity demand and a\nworkably competitive wholesale electricity market. This cost-of-service regulation\ndefault provider strategy is unnecessary if one believes that retail competition is viable.\nWe believe that the international experience from markets further along than California\nprovides ample evidence on the viability of retail competition. The competitive process\ncan be relied upon to offer this bare-bones retail pricing option if this is what retail\ncustomers demand. However, mandating a wholesale price pass-through rate for all\ncustomers virtually guarantees that any benefits from retail competition will be delayed\nalmost indefinitely and the adoption of real-time metering and electricity load monitoring\nand control information technology dramatically slowed.\n        A strategy that should provide more long-term consumer benefits is to rely on the\ncompetitive process to set the diversity of price and service quality options for final retail\ncustomers with the DPR option described above. Competition among ESPs and the\nUDCs should then allow customers to find the combination of price, metering\ntechnology, information systems (e.g., mechanisms for notifying customers of wholesale\nprices and technologies for automating their response) and other product characteristics\nthat best suit their preferences. One of goal of introducing competition into a former\nmonopoly industry is to serve the full diversity of consumer demands by offering a far\nwider range of products than the former monopolist. Those electricity retailers (ESPs or\nthe UDC) that provide true value-added to consumers in their retail product offerings will\nbe profitable and remain in the industry. Those that contribute no value-added will exit\nthe industry. Only by allowing this competitive sorting out process to take place will the\nfull benefits of retail competition come to pass in a timely manner. The end of the CTC\ncollection mechanism provides this opportunity.\n        Perhaps the most complex and difficult aspect of fostering retail competition is\ndetermining how much to charge each entity for metering services. One way to think of\nthe UDC’s existing metering infrastructure is as a stranded asset that is likely to be\nuneconomic on a going forward basis in the new competitive retail market. Clearly,\nremote metering reading technologies are more cost-effective on a going-forward basis\nthan the labor-intensive procedures currently used. Consequently, one way to handle the\nissue of charging ESPs for metering services, is to include any remaining unrecovered\nmeter installation costs on the UDC’s accounts as a stranded asset. Once the rate freeze\nends the UDC no longer receives any regulated cost recovery for meter installation,\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 96 of 148\n"

 [98] "reading and repair costs. An equivalent alternative that does not involve creating\nadditional stranded assets allows the recovery of any remaining historical metering\ninstallation costs in the UDC’s regulated distribution rates, but includes new meter\ninstallation costs and meter reading and repair costs in the competitive supply side of the\nUDC’s business. These costs must then be recovered out of retail rates, rather from the\nregulated distribution tariff. Coupled with the above recommendation of only requiring\nthe post-rate-freeze UDC to offer the DPR described up, shifting all metering services to\nthe competitive side of the UDC’s business creates additional opportunities for\ncompetitive entry into the provision of hourly metering services and the associated\ninformation systems necessary to use these hourly meters to manage the customer’s\nelectricity consumption in response to hourly prices.\n        One aspect of the mechanism by which real-time metering technology creates a\ncompetitive wholesale electricity market in California deserves emphasis. For the\nbeneficial effects of a price-responsive final demand to effect the bidding behavior of\ngeneration owners, total consumption over some time horizon does not have to be lower\nas a result of high prices during some hours of that time period. What is more important\nto disciplining the exercise of market power is that demand be able to shift hourly\nconsumption from hours when prices are high to hours when prices are low. Although\nthe ability to reduce total daily consumption in response to high prices during the day is\ncertainly desirable, the major benefit of a price-responsive wholesale demand in\ndisciplining generator bidding behavior is the ability to shift demand to other hours in the\nday in response to high prices, thus creating a more price-elastic aggregate hourly\nwholesale electricity demand.\n        A more price-responsive aggregate hourly wholesale electricity demand function\nwill cause all generation owners to bid more aggressively into the wholesale electricity\nmarket. These firms know that if they bid too high they will not be dispatched in that\nhour because a significant amount of load will decide not to consume during that hour in\nresponse to high prices. By this logic, it is easy to see that all loads, even those that are\nnot price-responsive on an hourly basis, benefit in terms of lower prices and reduced\nprice volatility from a significant amount of price-responsive demand in the market. This\nsuggests that there are benefits accruing to all consumers from the existence of price-\nresponsive consumers, and that a significant fraction of these benefits are not captured by\nthe customers providing them. This positive externality that price-responsive customers\nprovide to all other customers implies that it may be desirable to subsidize the installation\nof hourly metering technology. For many customers the private benefit of installing\nhourly meters does not exceed the private cost, but the social benefit to that customer\nfrom installing an hourly meter may exceed his private cost.\n8.

 [99] "generator compliance with ISO system operator dispatch instructions.              This non-\ncompliance took two forms.\n        In the first, a market participant would promise specific quantity of generating\ncapacity that met certain technical specifications, yet they would be unable to deliver this\nquantity of capacity according to these technical specification when called to do so. One\nsuch example of this problem occurred frequently in the Regulation reserve market. A\ngenerator might bid to supply 100MW of upward regulation and all of this capacity\nwould win in the ancillary services market. However, after 50 MW of the upward\nregulation capacity purchased was used and ISO requested that the unit regulate upward\nfurther, the generating unit would notify the ISO that certain modifications of the unit\nwere necessary before it could proceed to this higher level of regulation and that these\nmodifications would take a some time to implement. Under the ISO’s current ancillary\nservices market software, there is no way to detect and modify or reject a regulation bid\nof this type. Consequently, this created the need to purchase a larger nominal quantity of\nregulation reserve to insure that the ISO had sufficient regulation capacity that met the\ntechnical specifications necessary to meet its reserve requirements.\n        The second form of non-compliance occurred primarily in the real-time energy\nmarket. This problem arose primarily during periods of very high ISO prices. Under\nthese circumstances, when generators were quite certain that the hourly ex post price for\nimbalance energy would be quite high, they would begin to supply more than their day-\nahead energy schedule in anticipation of being paid for this according to an attractive\nhourly imbalance price. When this activity occurred on a large enough scale, it could\ncreate an oversupply of energy to the ISO grid so that the ISO system operator would\nthen have to call on decremental bids in the real-time energy bid stack. However, at these\ntimes, generators in the real-time bid stack were extremely reluctant to reduce their\ngeneration given that they knew net energy imbalances would be paid for at an attractive\nex post real-time price. Consequently, unit operators often did not comply with the\nterms implied by their decremental energy bids. The ISO system operator would then\nhave to move down to the next unit owner in the BEEP sequence while the over-\ngeneration situation became even more extreme. The likelihood of this non-compliance\nwith obligations associated with bidding into the real-time energy market further\nincreased the ISO’s demand for reserve capacity to guard against shortages of available\ngeneration to manage the grid in real-time.\n        It is important to bear in mind that the vast majority of these interactions between\nthe ISO operations staff and generation unit owners took place via the telephone.\nTherefore the amount of time spent attempting to find some generating unit willing to\nsupply the service usually made system reliability problem even larger. Guarding against\nthis compounding of problems due to time delays when non-compliance occurred further\nincreased the nominal demand for ancillary services reserve capacity.\n        Although it is difficult to quantify the cost of these non-compliance problems, it is\neasy to imagine instances when the costs can be extremely large.

[100] "and Logging Operations Program Environment (ANALOPE) to provide clear,\nindisputable dispatch instructions from the ISO to its market participants and an\nautomated repository of responses to those instructions. ANALOPE is designed to\nintegrate with the operation of the real-time energy market to accomplish a timely and\ntransparent dispatch. It will log, archive, and easily retrieve all information associated\nwith the dispatch process. ANALOPE will send an electronic dispatch instruction to a\nSC, receive response acknowledgement, log the transaction, and store the information to\nsupport dispute resolution. The information collected from ANALOPE will be essential\nto resolving disputes over non-compliance with ISO dispatch instructions or technical\nspecifications for the provision of an ancillary service.\n        In order to eliminate non-compliance behavior to the greatest extent possible, we\nencourage the ISO to publicize particularly egregious instances to all market participants\nand impose the maximum penalties possible under the terms of the ISO tariff.\n        Additional aspect of the non-compliance problem in the real-time energy stack is\ncurrently acknowledged and tolerated by the ISO system operator in an effort to increase\nthe depth of the real-time energy bid stack. Although the BEEP process dispatches\nresources in ten-minute intervals based on economic merit, in practice the ISO has been\naccommodating in this process several pre-dispatching resources with minimum run-time\nrequirements such as: (1) interties, (2) large base-load units, (3) hydro resources for water\nmanagement, and (4) gas turbines. These resources are dispatched for the whole hour\nwhether they are in the 10-minute BEEP stack or not. Currently, resources pre-\ndispatched in-sequence with minimum run-time requirements set the real-time market-\nclearing price for each of the six, ten-minute intervals in the hour, even if these resources\nare not marginal. Resources pre-dispatched in-sequence receive payments, or charge,\nbased on 10-minute BEEP market-clearing prices, not hourly ex post prices. Resources\npre-dispatched out-of-sequence receive payments, or charge, based on “as bid” prices.\nResources pre-dispatched out-of-market receive payment, or charge, based on Hourly Ex\nPost prices. This process of accepting bids with minimum run-times requirments has\ncreated an undue reliance on dispatcher’s judgement in determining which bids to accept,\nand because this judgement affects the hourly ex post price, this has lead to disputes\nbetween the ISO and market participants. Given the ISO market rules, allowing this\nform of non-compliance is unnecessary.\n        While during the initial stages of the ISO’s existence, it may have been necessary\nto compromise the market rules to insure that sufficient generation was available to\nmaintain system balance at all times and points in the grid, this is no longer necessary or\nadvisable. Under the current ISO rules, loads with minimum run-time requirements can\nparticipate in the ISO market by paying for deviations from 10-minute instructions given\nby the ISO according to the provisions of the current ISO tariff, under the same\nconditions that generating units without minimum run-time requirements now participate\nin the real-time energy market. Both types of generating units have the opportunity to\ndeviate from their hour-ahead energy schedules and ignore ISO dispatch instructions in\nreal-time if it is in their financial interest to do so. The ISO tariff charges resources\ndifferentially for instructed and uninstructed deviations from schedule to provide\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 99 of 148\n"

[101] "incentives for resources to follow real-time dispatch instructions. There are no further\npenalties for either type of deviation. By symmetric treatment of all resources using the\ncurrent ISO rules these slow-response resources can maintain their minimum run-time\nrequirement, yet bear they full cost that this requirement imposes on the real-time energy\nmarket. By treating these resources differently from resources that are able to respond\nmore quickly, the ISO is subsidizing slow-responding resources at the expense of quick-\nresponding resources. This differential treatment also dulls the incentive these slow-\nresponding resources have to undertake the investments or regulatory rule changes\nnecessary to become more responsive to 10-minute dispatch instructions. A frequent\ncomplaint of market participants is the lack of transparency in the real-time energy stack.\nGenerators complain that they often do not understand why a bid to produce in real-time\nwas not accepted. By treating all resources symmetrically in the BEEP dispatch process,\nmuch of this lack of transparency will be eliminated.\n        It is our understanding the ISO is currently considering a proposal to dispatch all\nresources on 10-minute dispatch interval and streamline payment or charge methods\nthroughout the 10-minute interval for all resources. For the reasons discussed above, we\nstrongly support this proposal.\n        As the California market matures, the ISO should continue to take steps to\ntransfer more of the risk associated with maintaining system reliability to those market\nparticipants best able to manage it. Because the California market design allows\ngenerators and loads the flexibility to deviate from their hour-ahead energy schedules and\nmake up the imbalances in the real-time energy market, the ISO must use financial\nincentives to manage the system in real-time. This is a major strength of the California\nmarket design relative markets where generators are explicitly penalized for deviations\nfrom day-ahead commitments. Generators in the California market are not unduly\nconstrained by day-ahead commitments should system conditions change from those\nanticipated on a day-ahead basis. However, this strength can be one of the market\ndesign’s greatest weaknesses if the economic signals generators receive in real time are\nnot closely matched with current conditions in the ISO system. For example, suppose\nelectricity demand in the ISO grid is currently rising, yet real-time energy prices are low\nbecause of delays in reflecting electricity supply and demand conditions in the real-time\nprice of electricity. This lag in system operations between economic signals to generators\nand the current supply and demand condition within the grid can increase rather than\ndecrease the shortfall between electricity supply and demand. Consequently, given the\nCalifornia market design, it is extremely important to the efficiency of the ISO’s market\nthat the physical condition of system as closely as possible match the financial conditions\nin market. For this reason, increasing the responsiveness of all resources or making them\npay the full cost of their lack of responsiveness is critical to the success of the California\nmarket design.\n

[102] "9.       Intra-Zonal Congestion Management, New Zone Creation, and\n         Interconnection by New Generators\n     This section deals with three interrelated issues: (1) intra-zonal congestion\nmanagement, (2) the conditions for new congestion zone creation, and (3) the terms and\nconditions under which a new generation owner can interconnect with the ISO grid. The\nfirst issue has to do with the day-to-day operation of the ISO grid, while the second two\nhave to do more with the long-term operation of the California electricity industry.\nCurrent ISO policies for creating a new congestion zone depend on the frequency of\ncongestion along transmission paths within an existing congestion zone on a six-month or\nannual basis. Consequently, the incentives that generators have for managing intra-zonal\ncongestion directly impact the number of new congestion zones and when and where\neach new congestion zone is created. Continuing this logic, the timing and location of\nnew congestion zones and the methods for managing congestion within these zones is a\nmajor factor in new generation location decisions within the ISO grid. For these reasons,\nwe believe these issues should be dealt with in a sequential manner, because the proper\nintra-zonal congestion management policy will make formulating a new zone creation\npolicy significantly more straightforward. An intra-zonal congestion management policy\nthat provides the best incentives to eliminating intra-zonal congestion combined with a\nnew zone creation policy that does not unnecessary favor new or existing entrants will\nsimplify the process of formulating a new generation connection policy.\n     The major market design flaws identified in this section are:\n1. The ISO’s current intra-zonal congestion management policy rewards the creation\n     and subsequent mitigation of intra-zonal congestion. For certain grid conditions,\n     strategically located generators can earn significant revenues from causing and then\n     mitigating intra-zonal congestion.\n2. Under ISO’s current intra-zonal congestion management policy, no market participant\n     has any incentive to eliminate intra-zonal congestion. Intra-zonal congestion costs\n     are simply a cost of selling energy in that congestion zone.\n3. The ISO’s current intra-zonal congestion management policies make an artificial\n     distinction between intra-zonal congestion management and local grid reliability.\n     Supplying energy to relieve intra-zonal congestion or for local grid reliability reasons\n     are observational equivalent from an economic perspective. In both cases, generation\n     units are being called to supply energy out of the bid sequence within a zone.\n4. The ISO’s new zone creation policy does attempt to control for the extent to which\n     the frequency of intra-zonal congestion along a transmission path depends on the\n     economic incentives faced by generators within the congestion zone. A major\n     determinant of the frequency of congestion along a transmission path (besides load\n     conditions on either side of the path) is the profitability of intra-zonal congestion on\n     this path to generation unit owners on either side of the path.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 101 of 148\n"

[103] "5. The opportunities for generators to exercise market power in the ISO’s day-ahead\n    ancillary services markets are considerably enhanced during periods when ancillary\n    services are procured on a zonal versus a statewide basis.\nOur major recommendations for correcting these market design flaws are:\n1. Revise ISO’s current intra-zonal congestion management protocols in one of the\n    following two ways:\n    •    Contract in advance for generation units to provide intra-zonal congestion relief\n         services on an annual basis at variable cost for an up-front annual payment similar\n         to the current RMR contracts. Procure these services through an annual\n         competitive bidding process which involves loads and transmission operators.\n    •    Manage intra-zonal congestion by using RMR units to supply the incremental\n         generation to relieve the intra-zonal congestion unless the unrestricted zonal\n         market can provide this energy. Generators are decremented according to their\n         bid prices to relieve intra-zonal congestion, but they must buy back the\n         decremental energy at the ex post hourly real-time price, not their decremental bid\n         price.\n2. Do not implement a policy to mitigate intra-zonal congestion in the forward market\n    until a policy with strong incentives to eliminate real-time intra-zonal congestion is in\n    place. Otherwise, generators may very likely be able to create intra-zonal congestion\n    in the forward market, get paid to relieve it, and then create it again in the real-time\n    market and get paid to relieve it there as well.\n3. Because of the increased opportunities to exercise market power in small congestion\n    zones, do not create any new congestion zones, including the current proposed\n    congestion zone south of Path 26 as a way to reduce intra-zonal congestion costs.\n    Unless creating a new congestion zone substantially improves the system reliability,\n    this process should be delayed until there is sufficient experience with the revised\n    intra-zonal congestion management protocols. An intra-zonal congestion management\n    policy that has incentives for all or some generators to eliminate intra-zonal\n    congestion should significantly reduce the frequency of intra-zonal congestion and\n    therefore eliminate the need to create a new congestion zone.\n4. Any viable new generation connection policy must contain a policy for managing\n    intra-zonal congestion. For the reasons discussed above, any analysis of the\n    economic efficiency properties of any new generation connection policy will crucially\n    depend on the intra-zonal congestion management policy in force.\n    The remainder of this section describes the current ISO policy for intra-zonal\ncongestion management and the incentives it creates for generator behavior.

[104] "ISO’s day-ahead ancillary services market when they are cleared on a zonal basis. This\nfollowed by a discussion of the ISO’s new zone creation policy, with specific application\nto the zone south of Path 26. We then discuss the ISO’s new generation connection\nproposals.\n    We then turn to our recommendations for a revising the current intra-zonal congestion\nmanagement protocols. The incentives for generator behavior provided by each policy\nare described. A discussion of the pros and cons of each proposal follow. We then give\nthe rationale underlying our recommendation against new zone creation as means to\nreduce intra-zonal congestion costs using our methodology for determining workably\ncompetitive congestion zones described in Section 13. Finally, we discuss the ISO’s new\ngeneration connection proposal, and the logic underlying our recommendation that it\nmust contain an mechanism for giving market participants the incentive to eliminate\nintra-zonal congestion.\n         A.        Current Intra-Zonal Congestion Management Policy\n         In order to gain a better understanding of the intra-zonal congestion problem in\nthe California, it is instructive to clarify the distinction between intra-zonal congestion\nand inter-zonal congestion. The ISO’s market-clearing process uses incremental and\ndecremental energy bids within the same SC to relieve inter-zonal congestion in both the\nday-ahead, hour-ahead and real-time markets. This implies that the outcome of accepting\ndecremental bids on one side of a inter-zonal transmission path and incremental bids on\nthe other side of the zonal transmission path will increase the market-clearing price in one\nzone and decrease the market-clearing price in the other congestion zone. Higher\nincremental energy bids lead to higher market-clearing zonal prices on the uncongested\nside of the path and lower decremental bids lead to lower market-clearing prices on the\ncongested side of the path. In contrast, under the ISO’s current intra-zonal congestion\nmanagement protocols, if the markets on both sides of the intra-zonal path are deemed\nworkably competitive, then the generator with the lowest incremental energy bid that can\nrelieve this congestion is paid his bid price for the additional energy generated. The\ngenerator with the highest decremental energy price that can relieve this congestion buys\nback the necessary energy at his bid price. If either side of the intra-zonal path is not\ndeemed workably competitive, then RMR units, if they are available, are used to relieve\nintra-zonal congestion on that side of transmission path.18\n         Neither bid prices nor the RMR variable payment rates (if RMR units are used to\nrelieve intra-zonal congestion) sets the zonal market-clearing price. By definition of\nintra-zonal congestion, one or both of these dispatch instructions are out-of-merit-order\nbecause there are lower-priced incremental energy bids and/or higher-priced decremental\nbids within the congestion zone that cannot be taken because they cannot relieve the\nintra-zonal congestion. Due to their location in the grid, only certain generators can\nrelieve the intra-zonal congestion, so their bids are the only ones that can be accepted.\nThe generator called out-of-merit-order in the real-time energy bid curve will not affect\n18\n   Currently the only intra-zonal congestion path deemed to have workably competitive generation markets\non both sides is the Path 26 interface.\n

[105] "the hourly price of energy in that zone. Total hourly intra-zonal congestion costs are paid\nby all SCs serving load in that congestion zone and exporting power from that congestion\nzone in proportion to the amount of electricity they consume or export during that hour,\nregardless of the location of the resources used to mitigate the intra-zonal congestion. As\nconsequence, intra-zonal congestion costs simply become an unavoidable cost paid by all\nSCs serving load in that congestion zone. There is no way for any SC serving load in that\narea to reduce its intra-zonal congestion costs without also reducing the intra-zonal\ncongestion costs of its competitors in that zone by exactly the same amount per unit of\nelectricity sold.\n        These rules for managing intra-zonal congestion create the following incentive for\nday-ahead scheduling and bidding into the supplemental energy market. Assume that\nduring a given hour, a 500 MW generator must sell its power along a path with 200 MW\nof remaining capacity. Suppose the day-ahead market has been run and the zonal price of\nenergy is $20/MWh and this generator won a hedge quantity of 500 MWh at this price.\nThis generator then schedules 500 MW of capacity along a path that can only take 200\nMW. Suppose that this generator is the only facility that can alleviate congestion along\nthis path in real time and it bids $10/MWH for decremental energy. When the ISO\nattempts to dispatch energy in real-time it will be forced to take the generator’s\ndecremental bid of $10/MWH for 300 MW of capacity, because only 200 MW of the 500\nMW scheduled can actually be produced in real-time.                   This generator pays\n($10/MWh)*(300 MWh) = $3000 to buy back the 300 MW of capacity that it cannot\ndeliver in real-time. Consequently, a generator that knew it was only able to sell 200\nMWh along the path receives (500 MWh)*$20/MWh = $10,000 for day-ahead energy\nsales, and net revenues from both these and the real-time purchase of 300 MW at\n$10/MWh, of $7000. Despite the fact that the day-ahead zonal price was $20/MWh, by\nscheduling capacity in this manner, the generator was able to receive an average price of\n$7,000/200MWh = $35/MWh for the energy it sold during that hour.\n        How confident a generator is that it owns the only facility that can alleviate the\nintra-zonal congestion will determines the level of its decremental bid price. For\nexample, a generator that knows with virtual certainty that it owns the only unit that can\nrelieve the intra-zonal congestion may bid the negative real-time energy price cap of\n-$750/MWh for decremental energy. In this case, the generation would be paid\n$750/MWh for each MWh that it sells back to the ISO in real time. This case the\ngenerator would receive $225,000 = ($750/MWH)*300 MW for these decremental\nenergy purchases in addition to the $10,000 for day-ahead energy sales for an average\nprice for 200 MWh of energy delivered of $1,175/MWh = $235,000/200 MWh.\nAlthough this example may seem to be extreme, during the first few weeks of June 1999\na generator was in this very favorable position for many hours and frequently submitted\ndecremental energy bids at the negative real-time energy price cap at that time of\n-$250/MWh.\n        The profitability of the above strategy relies on the fact that: (1) generators are\npaid their decremental bid to reduce the amount of energy they are willing to produce in\nreal time, and (2) only a small number of generation owners are able to relieve this intra-\nzonal congestion.

[106] "congestion, then we would expect competition among market participants to raise the\nprice of decremental energy bids. Viewed from this perspective, we can see that there is\nno meaningful distinction between an RMR call for local reliability reasons and an RMR\ncall to mitigate intra-zonal congestion when the market to relieve intra-zonal congestion\non one side of the transmission path is not workably competitive. In both cases the\ngeneration unit owner is the only entity, or one of a very small number of entities, that\ncan provide this essential service. If a spot market was run for the provision of this\nservice, then the generator could bid virtually any price to provide either service--intra-\nzonal congestion mitigation services or local grid reliability services—and it must be\ntaken.\n        Consequently, intra-zonal congestion mitigation in the case that the market on one\nside of the path is not workably competitive is observationally equivalent to the provision\nof local reliability services in those instances when a generator’s location in the grid\nmakes a minimal amount of energy from it essential to maintain the integrity of the grid.\nFor the case in which the uncongested side of the path is not workably competitive, the\nlevel of output from this unit necessary for local grid reliability is amount supplied after\nthe increase in generation necessary to relieve the intra-zonal congestion. In the case in\nwhich the congested side of the path is not workably competitive, the level of output from\nthis unit necessary for local grid reliability is the amount supplied after the decrease in\noutput necessary to relieve the intra-zonal congestion.\n        Although the vast majority of intra-zonal congestion costs during the first year\nISO operation was due to congestion along Path 26, over the past few months intra-zonal\ncongestion has frequently occurred on many other transmission paths. In addition,\ndespite concerns about the competitiveness of the energy market one or both sides of\nthese paths, there are often no RMR units which can be used to relieve this intra-zonal\ncongestion. Consequently, the prospects for larger intra-zonal costs along many paths in\nthe ISO control area over the coming year may result in the creation of more congestion\nzones. However, as shown above, because no market participant has an incentive to\nreduce intra-zonal congestion costs, yet, depending on system conditions, all generation\nunit owners have an incentive to cause intra-zonal congestion. The ISO’s intra-zonal\ncongestion management protocols should be revised to create incentives for market\nparticipants to eliminate intra-zonal congestion.\n        B.      Competitiveness of ISO’s Zonal Ancillary Services Market\n        The advantage of the ISO’s zonal market design is that if market participants have\nthe strong incentives not to cause intra-zonal and inter-zonal congestion, then competition\namong market participants to supply energy and ancillary services will be over the largest\nmarket possible. This implies that generators will have strong incentives to bid\naggressively to win in the statewide market for energy and ancillary services. However,\nwhen either inter-zonal or intra-zonal congestion occurs, this creates smaller markets for\nthe provision of both energy and ancillary services.

[107] "        We investigate the extent that this logic is true for the ISO’s ancillary services\nmarkets in two ways. In the first, we compare market-clearing zonal prices for ancillary\nservices when the ISO’s markets clear on a zonal basis versus statewide, controlling for\ndifferences in total ISO load across these two market outcomes. In the second analysis,\nwe compared the monthly frequency that at least one of the three IOUs or at least one the\nof the new generation owners was pivotal in the ISO’s ancillary services markets when\nthe markets were cleared statewide versus on a zonal basis.\n        Our methodology for determining the impact of zonal market-clearing on zonal\nancillary services prices uses the regression equation used to determine the average ISO-\nload-adjusted ancillary services prices last summer versus this past summer discussed in\nSection 3. The only difference is that we estimate separate equations for each congestion\nzone, separately for the period from June 1, 1998 to December 31, 1998 and for the\nperiod January 1, 1999 to August 17, 1999. The dependent variable in each regression is:\nPAS(c,i,j) = the market-clearing day-ahead price for ancillary services i, for congestion\n        zone c, during hour j\n        The variable of interest in this case is the coefficient associated with\nCONG(j) = an indicator variable that equals one if the ISO procures ancillary services on\n        a zonal basis.\nThe coefficient associated with this variable measures the ISO-load-adjusted difference in\nancillary services prices in the congestion zone that results from procuring ancillary\nservices on a zonal basis. For each congestion zone and each hour for the 1998 and 1999\nseparate sample periods, we regress PAS(c,i,j) on a constant term, a sixth order\npolynomial in ISOLOAD(j), a complete set of DAY, HOUR, MONTH indicator\nvariables, and the indicator variable CONG(j).\n        Table 7 reports the values of the coefficient associated with CONG and associated\nstandard errors for the NP15 and SP15 congestion zones for the June 1, 1998 to\nDecember 31, 1998 time period. The results presented in this table tell a very plausible\nstory about the impact of zonal procurement of ancillary services in light of the CTC\nrecovery mechanism in place and the large amount of generation capacity in the NP15\ncongestion zone owned by Pacific Gas and Electric for much of 1998. When ancillary\nservices were procured on a zonal basis, prices tended to be significantly higher in SP15,\nwhich is consistent with the fact that NGOs, who receive greater revenues from higher\nancillary services prices, owned the vast majority of capacity able to provide ancillary\nservices in SP15. In NP15, zonal procurement of ancillary services led to lower prices.\nThis is consistent with the fact that over the majority of this sample period Pacific Gas\nand Electric was the major supplier of ancillary services in the NP15 and its incentives\nare to keep energy and ancillary services prices low in order to increase its CTC recovery.\nThe conclusion to be drawn from this time period is that the overall impact of zonal\nprocurement is ambiguous.

[108] "         Re-running these regressions for 1999 provides a different result. Table 8 reports\nthe values of the coefficients associated with CONG and the associated standard errors\nfor the NP15 and SP15 congestion zones. Here the conclusion is that zonal procurement\nhas little impact on prices in the NP15 congestion zone in 1999, whereas for Regulation\nand Spinning Reserve zonal procurement lead to dramatically higher zonal prices in the\nSP15 congestion zone. The NP15 result for 1999 is consistent with the view that the\ntransfer of a significant amount of Pacific Gas and Electric capacity to the Southern\nCompany has led to less aggressive bidding (a higher bid price for the same quantity of\ncapacity) into the NP15 ancillary services market during periods when markets are\ncleared on a zonal basis. We should note that in light of these results it is very fortuitous\nthat the ISO procured ancillary services on a zonal basis during 1999 very infrequently.\n   Table 7: Average Price Difference Due to Zonal Market-Clearing of Ancillary\n             Services Market for Period June 1, 1998 to December 31, 1998\n                                                                   CGFLAG\n       Market            Congestion Zone\n                                                             Estimate       Standard Error\n                                NP15                             -18.73                  2.30\nRegulation\n                                SP15                              20.60                  2.83\n                                NP15                             -18.98                  2.08\nSpin\n                                SP15                              64.06                  2.84\n                                NP15                             -16.06                  1.57\nNon-Spin\n                                SP15                              -1.24                  1.68\n                                NP15                             -21.35                  1.59\nReplacement\n                                SP15                              50.60                15.89\n                                NP15                               0.15                  0.95\nReal\n                                SP15                              -0.73                  0.94\n   Table 8: Average Price Difference Due to Zonal Market-Clearing of Ancillary\n             Services Market for Period January 1, 1999 to August 17, 1999\n                                                                   CGFLAG\n       Market            Congestion Zone\n                                                             Estimate       Standard Error\n                                NP15                               1.03                11.53\nRegulation\n                                SP15                              87.14                11.63\n                                NP15                              -0.70                  1.83\nSpin\n                                SP15                              83.26                  2.24\n                                NP15                              -0.23                  1.83\nNon-Spin\n                                SP15                               1.33                  1.82\n                                NP15                               0.82                  1.68\nReplacement\n                                SP15                              -0.27                  1.68\n                                NP15                               0.93                  2.85\nReal\n                                SP15                               1.05                  2.85\n         The second analysis we perform uses the concept of a bidder being pivotal in the\nISO’s ancillary services.

[109] "         removing all of its bids from the market, regardless of their bid price, this causes the\n         market to have an insufficient supply at any price to meet the aggregate demand for that\n         ancillary service. During an hour that a bidder is pivotal, it should be able to set\n         whatever price it would like in the market by its bid and still sell a positive amount of\n         capacity into the market. Because all bidders submit their ancillary services bids at the\n         same time, a bidder can only learn if it is pivotal after all bids have been submitted.\n                 Figure 55 repeats our construction of a residual demand curve for the case in\n         which the bidder is pivotal. In this case, SO(p), the supply curve of all other market\n         participants besides the firm under consideration, becomes vertical before it crosses the\n         aggregate demand curve QD. For simplicity, we have drawn aggregate demand to be\n         completely price inelastic. For the reasons discussed above, this is not an unrealistic\n         assumption for the aggregate demand for of any of the ISO’s ancillary services markets\n         over the time period we study. The resulting residual demand curve for the firm is\n         DR(p). The minimum amount that SO(p) falls short of QD is equal to QP. This implies\n         that the firm faces a completely price inelastic residual demand for the quantity QP. From\n         the diagram it is clear that the firm earns the greatest revenues by bidding all of its\n         capacity at the price cap of Pmax. This strategy sets the market price at Pmax and earns the\n         unit owner (Pmax)x(QP) in total revenues. Consequently, during periods in which a\n         generator estimates that with very high probability it is pivotal, this is the optimal supply\n         bid function so long as QP is not too small. Note that the larger Pmax is the smaller QP can\n         be and still result in the optimal bidding strategy being all of the generator’s remaining\n         capacity at the price cap.\n

[110] "        In a market without a price cap, if a generator knows with very high probability\nthat during a certain hour it will be pivotal then there should be no upper bound on its\neconomically optimal bid price. (There may be other constraints on how high a price a\ngeneration unit owner can bid.) What the generator loses on the volume of sales, it can\nmake up in the bid price for those sales. To the extent that a market participant is able to\naccurately forecast when it will be pivotal and the frequency that this event occurs are\nboth measure of the extent of potential market power possessed by that market\nparticipant. It seems reasonable to assume that if the event occurs more frequently, then\nit should be easier for the market participant to forecast when this event will occur.\nConsequently, we take the frequency of this event as our measure of potential market\npower.\n        Because of confidentiality concerns we do not report pivotal bidder frequency by\nindividual market participants. Instead we compute, for each day-ahead ancillary\nservices market, the monthly frequency—percentage of hours in the month--that at least\none of the three IOUs was pivotal in that day-ahead ancillary services market. We also\nreport, for each day-ahead ancillary services market, the monthly frequency that at least\none of the NGOs was pivotal in that market. We account for generation unit ownership\nchanges in over the sample period when computing these two pivotal bidder frequencies.\nTables 9(a)-9(c) contain the monthly IOU and NGO pivotal bidder frequency when the\nday-ahead market was cleared on a statewide basis and the pivotal bidder frequencies for\nNP15 and SP15 separately when the day-ahead ancillary services markets were cleared\non a zonal basis for the summer months of 1998. Table 10(a)-10(c) computes these same\nnumbers for the summer months of 1999. The sample for August 1999 ends on August\n17, the day before the Rational Buyer protocol was implemented. Because the ancillary\nservices markets were not cleared on a zonal basis during July or August 1999, these\nrows are omitted from Tables 10(b) and 10(c).\n            Table 9(a): Pivot Bidder

First, when the ancillary services\nmarkets were cleared on a statewide basis the pivotal bidder frequencies for the summer\nof 1998 were significantly higher than the pivotal bidder frequencies for the summer of\n1999. The other conclusion that holds across both years, is that when the markets are\ncleared on a zonal basis, the pivotal bidder frequency is significantly higher than when\nthe markets clear on a statewide basis. These results argue in favor of the view that the\nmany of the market structure and market rule changes over the past year have reduced the\nextent of market power in the ancillary services market. However, there are two\nimportant caveats associated with this conclusion. The first is that when markets clear on\na zonal basis, even during the summer of 1998, the pivotal bidder frequencies are\nextremely high for several ancillary services. Second, some portion of the reduction in\npivotal bidder frequencies for both the IOUs and NGOs when these markets clear on a\nstatewide basis between the summer of 1998 and summer of 1999 can be attributed to the\nreduced demand for ancillary services in 1999 due to mild weather conditions. A major\nreason for the lower pivotal bidder frequencies in the day-ahead ancillary services\nmarkets in 1999 is the ISO’s policy, implemented in April 1999, to delay some day-ahead\npurchases to the hour-ahead market in order to lower total ancillary services costs and\nincreased the liquidity of the hour-ahead market. These results provide significant\nevidence that this strategy has be effective at reducing the potential for generation unit\nowners to exercise market power in the day-ahead ancillary services markets.\n         C.     ISO New Zone Creation Policy\n         ISO’s tariff allows for the creation of a new congestion zone according two\ncriteria: (1) the cost of intra-zonal congestion mitigation, and (2) the existence of a\nworkably competitive market in each of the two new zones. The ISO tariff states that if\nthe cost of intra-zonal congestion mitigation over a 12-month period exceeds at least 5%\nof the product of the rated capacity of the path and the weighted average

[113] "of the participating Transmission Operators (TOs), the ISO may create a new zone. If\nduring the initial the 6-months of ISO operations this cost exceeds 10% of an analogous\nmagnitude, the ISO may create a new congestion zone. Intra-zonal congestion on Path 26\nduring both the first six months and first year of ISO operation exceeded the cost\ncriterion for new zone creation.\n        However, following the methodology outlined in Section 13, we arrive at the\nconclusion that it is very unlikely that there is a workably competitive zone on at least\none side of the interface. Our logic is first based on our results on the impact of zonal\nmarket-clearing on ancillary services prices in SP15. The proposed structure of the new\nzone north of Path 26 and south of Path 15 (SP15-NP26), the new SP15-NP26 zone will\ntake approximately 3,000 MW of generation capacity from the old SP15 zone, but it will\nonly have approximately 300 MW of load within the zone. Path 26 had a 3,000 MW bi-\ndirectional rating until November 1998. It was reduced to 2,400 MW for the 1998-99\nwinter season and increased to 2,800 for the summer of 1999. When there is congestion\nflowing from north to south on the SP26 interface, load in this new zone will only be\nreduced by approximately 300MW, but it will now have to be served by approximately\n3,000 MW less capacity. One can expect that during these periods, the opportunities to\nexercise market power in the energy and ancillary services markets within the SP26 zone\nare significantly greater than the opportunities that previously existed under similar load\nconditions in the old SP15 zone. In addition, if SP26 transmission path is de-rated, then\nwe would expect an even greater imbalance between load and available generation\ncapacity within the zone, leading to even greater opportunities to exercise market power\nin the new zonal market for energy and ancillary services beyond what was possible in\nthe original SP15 zone.\n        D.      New Generation Connection Policy\n        The two main proposals considered by the ISO Board for charging a new\ngenerator to interconnect are summarized below. The economic efficiency properties of\neach New Generation Interconnection Policy (NGIP) proposal are then analyzed. We\nargue that neither the Advance Congestion Cost Mitigation (ACCM) proposal nor the No\nGrandfathering of Transmission Rights (NGTR) proposal provides the proper economic\nincentives for when and where to construct new transmission and generation facilities to\nalleviate intra-zonal congestion. This is due in large part to the current ISO protocols for\nrelieving intra-zonal congestion.\n        The zonal nature of the California electricity market and the current ISO protocols\nfor managing intra-zonal congestion, combined with the fact that transmission upgrades\ncan often substitute for generation capacity in meeting many local reliability needs makes\ndesigning an NGIP an extremely complex task. An NGIP must give generation\ncompanies locational price signals for siting new facilities which increase the efficiency\nof the energy and ancillary services markets. Transmission owners must face price\nsignals which cause them to make transmission upgrades when these result in a lower\ncost solution to local reliability problems than investment in new generation capacity.\nTransmission owners should also have a financial incentive to maintain the amount and\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 112 of 148\n"

[114] "geographic distribution of transmission capacity necessary for the energy and ancillary\nservices markets in California to function efficiently.\n        Designing an NGIP requires trading off the financial gains of some market\nparticipants against those of other market participants. One conclusion to emerge from\nour discussion of these proposals is the necessity of a revision of the ISO intra-zonal\ncongestion management protocols to provide incentives for market participants to\nalleviate intra-zonal congestion. Given an intra-zonal congestion management policy that\nenhances market efficiency, designing an appropriate NGIP becomes a significantly more\nstraightforward task.\n                 1.      New Generation Interconnection Policies under Consideration\n        If the owner/representative of a new generating unit (NewGen) would like to\nconnect that unit to the ISO grid, the NewGen must request a system impact and facilities\nstudy (Impact Study) from the associated Participating Transmission Owner (PTO). That\nstudy will identify reliability issues as well as incremental intra-zonal congestion caused\nby the NewGen. The ISO Tariff states that the NewGen must mitigate any reliability\nissues identified by the Impact Study. The NewGen may accomplish this by paying for\ntransmission system upgrades to correct the problem or, in some cases, by implementing\na Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) that would change the unit’s operations as necessary\nto relieve the reliability concern. However, the ISO Tariff is not clear on whether or how\nthe NewGen must address incremental congestion, specifically intra-zonal congestion,\ncaused by the new unit.\n    On this issue, the ISO Board considered two primary policy options:\n    1. “Advance Congestion Cost Mitigation” (ACCM): With this policy, NewGens\n        would be required to either pay for transmission upgrades or implement operating\n        procedures (e.g., curtail their generator’s output) that would, under certain\n        circumstances, mitigate the incremental congestion they cause. In addition, this\n        policy would require “future generators” (those that connect to the grid after\n        NewGen’s project) to complete the same mitigation measure. As a result,\n        congestion in the local area surrounding NewGen will be approximately the same\n        after it and any future generator connects in the area.\n    2. “No Grandfathering of Transmission Rights” (NGTR): With this policy,\n        NewGens would not be required to pay to mitigate the increased intra-zonal\n        congestion “caused” by their projects, nor would any future generators be\n        required to mitigate the additional intra-zonal congestion. SCs would use existing\n        ISO real-time energy market tools to manage any future intra-zonal congestion.\nUnder both the ACCM and NGTR approaches, NewGens would be required to address\nall grid upgrades necessary to maintain the reliability of the ISO grid. Under both\nproposals, NewGens could voluntarily invest in grid upgrades and would be entitled to\nany “system benefits” that arise as a consequence of their investment.

[115] "only a portion of the upgrade is necessary to mitigate the intra-zonal congestion caused\nby the NewGen’s entry.\n        If the connection of the NewGen to the grid leads to excessive intra-zonal\ncongestion and results in the creation of a new zone based on ISO Tariff Section 7.2.7,\nthere should be no difference between the two methods. This is because the Tariff allows\nthe new zone to be created only if there is a competitive generation market in each of the\ntwo new zones. If this is the case, the NewGen would have to be exempt from paying to\nmitigate intra-zonal congestion, because it will now be inter-zonal rather than intra-zonal\ncongestion, and the former can be mitigated through the inter-zonal congestion\nmanagement across the competitive zonal markets. The two methods would lead to\ndifferent results only when the NewGen connection leads to excessive intra-zonal\ncongestion, but there is insufficient competition to allow creation of a new zone.\nHowever, one can imagine instances where the mitigation measure undertaken by the\nnew entrant under the ACCM proposal would reduce the frequency of intra-zonal\ncongestion so that a new zone would not need to be created. Whereas under the NGTR\napproach a new zone will be created because no mitigation measures were undertaken in\nadvance of entry.\n        To determine the impact of the NewGen on intra-zonal congestion in the “impact”\nstudies, the “worst-case” scenario (for the most severe credible contingency in the hour\nwhere the system is most stressed) is compared with and without the NewGen. If an intra-\nzonal interface is congested with the NewGen with a flow increase of 5% or more\ncompared with the no NewGen case, the NewGen is assumed to be responsible for\ncreating the intra-zonal congestion. Implicitly, it is assumed that such a condition could\neventually lead to the creation of a new zone if the cost of congestion exceeded 5% of the\nannual access fee and there exists competitive generation markets on both sides of the\nzone which is created. To determine whether or not congestion can be mitigated through\ncompetitive markets, the ISO Board has adopted the 20% rule, i.e., to have a competitive\nmarket no one firm can own more than 20% of generation in the new zone.\n                2.      Analysis of Two Proposals\n        The main question we address is whether the ACCM or NGTR will lead to the\nmost efficient market for electricity in California given the current ISO protocols for\nmanaging intra-zonal congestion and creating new congestion zones. The ACCM assigns\nresponsibility for all additional intra-zonal congestion to the new entrant, despite the fact\nthat this new entrant sometimes provides benefits to all consumers within the zone or the\nstate by relieving intra-zonal congestion at a lower price or setting a lower state-wide or\nzonal price for energy. In this dimension, the ACCM is inferior to the NGTR. However,\nthe NGTR does not address the incentives in a zonal electricity market, such as the one\nthat exists in California, for new generators to locate where they can create and benefit\nfrom intra-zonal congestion. For this reason, the NGTR proposal in its current form is\nnot recommended. Finally, neither proposal provides incentives for the Participating\nTransmission Operator (PTO) to undertake transmission upgrades necessary to reduce the\nincidence of intra-zonal congestion or to substitute for additional generating capacity\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 114 of 148\n"

[116] "when a transmission upgrade yields a lower cost solution to a local grid reliability\nproblem.\n                3.      ACCM Proposal\n        Any firm considering whether to enter the California market must determine if it\nwill be able to recover all of the up-front fixed costs associated with constructing a new\ngenerating facility and connecting it to the ISO grid from selling electricity in the\nCalifornia market. Any increase in the up-front cost necessary to enter the California\nmarket will tend to raise the average price of electricity in California necessary to cause\nnew generation to enter the market. Because the ACCM charges all incremental intra-\nzonal congestion costs to the new entrant, this policy implies that a higher average market\nprice will be required to trigger new entry into the California electricity market. The\nNewGen must recover these up-front congestion charges from the revenues it expects to\nearn from participating in the market.\n        However, if the NewGen has a lower marginal cost than existing generators, there\nwill be times when the zonal or statewide price of electricity will be lower because this\nfirm is present in the market. In addition, there will also be times when this firm is able\nto relieve intra-zonal congestion at a lower price than existing firms. Because all\ncustomers in a zone pay the same price of energy and pay intra-zonal congestion costs in\nproportion to their electricity consumption, the presence of this firm provides tangible\nbenefits to consumers during many hours. The ACCM proposal does not compensate\ngenerators for these system benefits, but requires them to pay all of the incremental intra-\nzonal congestion costs they impose on the transmission grid. This asymmetry of\ncharging new entrants for the costs they impose on the system without netting out all of\nthe benefits they provide to the system can increase the cost of entry by new generators.\n        Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to compute the benefits that a new entrant\nprovides to the market. During periods when the new entrant sets the market price, the\ndifference between the price bid that would clear the market without the new entrant and\nthe bid that actually cleared the market could measure of how much lower prices are as a\nresult of the new entrant. However, this measure does not capture the impact of more\naggressiveness bidding by other market participants as a result the presence of a new\nentrant. In addition, if the new entrant was rewarded with a portion of the benefits that it\nprovided to market as defined by the above measure, it may distort its bidding behavior to\nset lower market prices.\n        In addition, it is extremely difficult to determine the cost of incremental intra-\nzonal congestion that a new entrant imposes on existing firms. Such a calculation will\nrequire value judgements that are likely to exert and a large influence on the results.\nSpecifically, the cost of intra-zonal congestion depends on the bids generators submit and\nthe ISO accepts to relieve the congestion. It is also very difficult to distinguish grid\nupgrades required for reliability reasons and those undertaken to relieve intra-zonal\ncongestion. Clearly grid upgrades made for reliability a very likely to reduce the level of\ngrid investment necessary to relieve intra-zonal congestion.

[117] "impact grid reliability yet causes intra-zonal congestion, produce in a manner that\nadversely impacts grid reliability yet does not cause intra-zonal congestion, or produce in\na manner that does not adversely impact grid reliability or cause intra-zonal congestion.\n         Because the ACCM policy charges the new entrant for incremental intra-zonal\ncongestion in the form of an up-front payment that does not net out the benefits that this\nentrant provides to other market participants described above, ACCM creates two\npotential sources of efficiency losses. First, existing generators are able to earn higher\nprices as a result of the up-front payment charged to new entrants under the ACCM\nscheme, because an upper bound on the annual average price of electricity in California is\nthe expected average total cost of a new entrant. Second, new entry may be delayed\nrelative to the case in which the ACCM scheme does not exist, because new entrants\nmust wait longer for sufficient demand growth to occur and produce wholesale electricity\nprices that are high enough to make new generation capacity economic.\n         A new entrant treats the ACCM as a sunk cost of entry, i.e., a cost which cannot\nbe recovered upon exit from the industry. Furthermore, this cost is not paid by existing\ngenerators. The higher are the perceived sunk costs of entry, the higher market prices can\nbe above the marginal cost of production and not trigger new entry. One major goal of an\nefficient market design is to eliminate unnecessary barriers to entry. Efficient entry is\nencouraged if entrants are charged for the negative externalities their entry imposes on\nother market participants, and credited for any positive externalities their entry imposes\non other market participants. Net entry charges in excess of those implied by this\nprinciple constitute unnecessary barriers to entry.\n         An additional shortcoming of the ACCM scheme arises because it assigns an\nunwarranted level of significance to the current level and location of intra-zonal\ncongestion by requiring new entrants to maintain the pre-entry level of intra-zonal\ncongestion. There is no definitive evidence that the current level and location intra-zonal\ncongestion is the optimal in the sense that it leads to the most efficient mode of operation\nof the California energy and ancillary services market. By requiring new entrants to\nmitigate intra-zonal congestion to current levels with grid upgrades, the ACCM may\nunnecessarily prevent some of market-efficiency-enhancing upgrades of the transmission\ngrid, or require too many upgrades of other transmission paths.\n         The potential barrier to entry caused by the ACCM may be even greater for\nsubsequent entrants. Because the ACCM requires all new entrants pay to enhance the\ntransmission grid so that the level of intra-zonal congestion is approximately same as\nbefore it entered the market, the cost of this intra-zonal congestion mitigation measure\nunder the ACCM proposal could be even larger for subsequent entrants. Consequently,\nentry barriers may rise over time, delaying subsequent new entry and increase the price of\nelectricity necessary to attract such new entry. Alternatively, because of the lumpiness of\ntransmission enhancements, the second entrant could “free ride” off of the proposed\nupgrades of the first entrant and therefore incur very small or even zero ACCM\npayments. This free-riding problem could be so extreme that neither entrant wants to be\nfirst into the market.

[118] "either would enter second. This could create a circumstance where all market\nparticipants recognize the need for new generating capacity in California, but no new\ninvestment occurs, because no prospective entrant wants to be the first to commit to a\nnew generation project and pay the significantly higher first-entrant ACCM charge. This\ncould also create the situation that once entry occurs and the first mitigation measure is\ncomplete, there would then be a rush to be the one of the next entrants that do not have to\nundertake costly mitigation measures. In theory, coordination between entrants to\nmitigate intra-zonal congestion could solve these free-riding problems, but whether such\ncoordination will be achieved in practice is an open question.\n        The analysis up to now has assumed that the cost to enhance the grid so that the\nlevel of intra-zonal congestion is the same as before the new entry occurred is known, or\nat least relatively easy to calculate. However, determining the magnitude of this cost is\nlikely to be an extremely contentious process particularly because the new entrant must\npay it. For this reason, existing firms have a strong incentive to inflate these costs. In\naddition, because the PTO has a financial stake in this process, it has incentives to\nproduce Impact Studies for new entrants that favor its financial interests. Consequently,\nimplementing this proposal is likely to cause disputes over the mitigation measures\nrequired, which themselves could delay entry.\n                 4.      NGTR Proposal\n        The NGTR proposal does not create potential barriers to entry similar to the\nACCM proposal, because new entrants do not have to pay up-front to mitigate\nincremental intra-zonal congestion. Both new entrants and existing generators are treated\nsymmetrically in terms of the intra-zonal congestion they cause. Under the NGTR\nscheme, if a new generator can produce energy more cheaply than an existing generator,\nthat generator will find it profitable to enter and undercut the existing generator. Because\nthe sunk costs of new entry are lower under the NGTR scheme than under the ACCM\nscheme, we would expect that lower electricity prices would be required to attract new\nentry. In addition, new entry could occur more rapidly in response to a growing demand\nfor electricity than it would under the ACCM scheme.\n        However, the NGTR scheme can lead to excessive entry if entrants cause\ncongestion and thus impose negative externalities on existing generators. Even more\npointedly, NGTR also fails to address the major problem with the ISO’s intra-zonal\ncongestion management protocols that can lead to incentives for new entrants to locate\ntheir facilities to increase intra-zonal congestion. As noted above, current intra-zonal\ncongestion management protocols allow unit owners to buy back energy commitments on\nthe congested side of a path according to their unit-specific decremental bid prices, and\nsell additional energy on the uncongested side according to their unit-specific incremental\nbid prices. If generators on the congested side of the path whose decremental bids are\naccepted have some of their forward energy commitments met by the ISO, they receive\nthe difference between the forward energy market price and their decremental bid for the\namount of capacity that is decremented.\n                         MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 117 of 148\n"

[119] "         It is important to emphasize, that by definition of intra-zonal congestion, at least\none payment to relieve intra-zonal congestion is out of merit order, because there are\nlower-priced incremental energy bids and/or higher-priced decremental bids within the\ncongestion zone cannot be taken because of intra-zonal congestion. Due to their location\nin the grid, only certain generators can relieve the intra-zonal congestion, so their bids are\nthe only ones that can be accepted. The generator called out-of-merit-order in the real-\ntime energy bid curve will not affect the hourly price of energy in that zone. Any out-of-\nmerit-order decremental or increments payments will not affect the hourly real-time price\nof electricity in that congestion zone.\n         The NGTR proposal combined with the current ISO market rules may make it\nprofitable for a firm to enter at points in the California grid which satisfy two criteria: (1)\nsupplying more electricity at this point will increase the frequency of intra-zonal\ncongestion, and (2) the generation owner is the only market participant able to relieve this\nintra-zonal congestion. If there are other generators able to relieve this intra-zonal\ncongestion, the above strategy of scheduling to cause intra-zonal congestion should be\nless profitable, because there will be competition to supply the decremental energy bids\nnecessary to relieve this congestion.\n         The shortcomings of the current ACCM and NGTR proposals described above\nhighlight the challenges that must addressed by any NGIP because of the current ISO\nprotocols for relieving intra-zonal congestion. The major goal of an NGIP is to give the\nlocational price signals for new generators to enter where they provide the greatest\nbenefits to California electricity consumers. A second goal is to provide incentives for\nPTOs to undertake transmission upgrades that alleviate intra-zonal congestion along a\ntransmission path at a lower cost than out of merit purchases and sales of electricity. A\nthird goal is to involve loads in the intra-zonal congestion management process to the\ngreatest extent possible. Currently, all loads within the zone pay higher prices because of\nintra-zonal congestion in form of charges levied on all energy consumed in the\ncongestion zone, regardless of the load’s location in the zone. This mode of pricing intra-\nzonal congestion provides very muted incentives for loads to consume in a manner that\nreduces the cost of relieving intra-zonal congestion. All of these goals for a NGIP require\nthe ISO to have an intra-zonal congestion management protocol that gives as many\nmarket participants as possible strong incentives to eliminate intra-zonal congestion. In\nthe next section we describes changes in the ISO’s intra-zonal congestion management\nprotocols that come closer to achieving this end.\n         E.      Recommended Changes                    in      Intra-Zonal     Congestion\n                 Management Protocols\n         The major problem with the ISO’s intra-zonal congestion management protocols\nis that they provide no market participants with a strong incentive to eliminate intra-zonal\ncongestion and give many market participants the incentive to cause intra-zonal\ncongestion. Both of our recommended modifications eliminate some of the incentives to\ncause intra-zonal congestion by giving other market-participants strong incentives to\nreduce the amount of intra-zonal congestion.

[120] "described earlier about the false distinction between local grid reliability services and\nintra-zonal congestion mitigation services. In this case, we propose to use RMR units to\nmitigate intra-zonal congestion because intra-zonal congestion mitigation is economically\nequivalent to providing local reliability services. The second approach attempts to use a\nmore market-based solution. For this reason it may be more risky in terms of the\nopportunities for the exercise of market power, but it also has the greater upside in terms\nof solving the current incentives to cause intra-zonal congestion.\n                 1.     Cost-Based Intra-Zonal Mitigation\n         The first scheme relies on the logic expressed earlier that the distinction between\nrequiring energy from a single unit or one of a small number of units for local grid\nreliability reasons is difficult to distinguish from a requiring energy from a unit or one of\na small number of units to relieve intra-zonal congestion. In both cases, the generator is\nrequired to provide this service regardless of the magnitude of its bid price relative to the\nmarket-clearing price. Consequently, this scheme would use RMR calls whenever it is\nnecessary to skip over bids in the real-time energy bid stack to relieve intra-zonal\ncongestion. Specifically, if the ISO is required to skip over bids on either side of a\ncongested path, then it would be required to call on a RMR unit to relieve congestion on\nthat side of the path. If the congestion on one side of the path could be satisfied without\nskipping over bids in the real-time energy stack, then that bid would be taken. For\nexample, if incremental energy to relieve intra-zonal congestion happens to set the\nunconstrained 10-minute price in the zone, then there is no need to use an RMR unit to\nrelieve intra-zonal congestion. However, if relieving intra-zonal congestion in the\nincremental and/or decremental direction requires skipping over bids in the real-time\nenergy bid stack, then RMR units should be used to meet the incremental and/or\ndecremental energy.\n         This scheme would eliminate the somewhat artificial distinction between local\nmonopoly power because of local grid reliability concerns and local monopoly power\nbecause of the unit’s location relative to the location of intra-zonal congestion. This\nscheme prevents RMR unit owners from exercising market power at times they are a\nmonopoly or part of a duopoly for intra-zonal congestion mitigation. Clearly, because\nbids are being skipped, an unrestricted zonal market for energy is no longer operating\nsimilar to the case that it would be necessary to skip bids to pick generation units in\nspecific locations to solve local grid reliability problems which motivated the creation of\nRMR contracts.\n         Under this scheme, the threat of RMR calls if the unrestricted zonal energy\nmarket does not operate gives a strong incentive for this group of market participants to\ndispatch all of their generation units (RMR and non-RMR) to reduce the likelihood of\nintra-zonal congestion preventing this outcome from occurring. RMR unit owners now\nhave a financial interest in eliminating intra-zonal congestion and supporting an\nunrestricted zonal market. Under the current RMR contracts they are paid variable cost\nfor supplying RMR energy, and would clearly prefer to receive a market-determined\nprice above their variable cost.

[121] "         In order to eliminate the unavoidable cost feature of the current intra-zonal\ncongestion management protocols, this scheme would charge these RMR calls to the\nPTOs. Charging PTO’s for RMR calls give them a financial incentive to make the\nappropriate grid upgrades if this is cheaper than paying for RMR calls to relieve intra-\nzonal congestion. This logic is also in line with our view that there is no essential\neconomic distinction between local reliability services and intra-zonal congestion\nmitigation under local monopoly or duopoly situations. The PTOs currently pay for\nRMR calls for local reliability services, so that this requirement would make our scheme\ninternally consistent with this logic.\n         This scheme could also allow other market participants--loads and new generation\nentrants--to relieve intra-zonal congestion. For example, each year the ISO could put out\nto bid the up-front fixed payment for an RMR contract to satisfy certain system reliability\nneeds for a given geographic region in the ISO control area. Given these bids, the PTOs\ncould then decide instead to reduce their RMR unit capacity requirement and the\nmagnitude of associated up-front payments. They would undertake transmission grid\nexpansion to reduce the level of intra-zonal congestion. In this way, a trade-off between\nnew generation and transmission upgrades would enter into the process for relieving\nintra-zonal congestion.\n         The downside of this scheme is the increased reliance on RMR contracts, which\nruns contrary to the ISO Board’s stated goal of reducing the number of RMR units.\nDespite this apparent increased reliance on RMR contracts, it does not follow that there\nwill be more RMR units or a larger quantity of energy provided under the terms of RMR\ncontracts. The PTOs will undertake transmission upgrades to eliminate the need for\nRMR units where the costs of relieving intra-zonal congestion from RMR calls is more\nthan the cost doing so through a transmission upgrade. Because RMR unit owners have a\nfinancial stake in reducing the level of intra-zonal congestion, they will have a financial\nincentive to dispatch all of their units to reduce the likelihood of intra-zonal congestion\nduring periods expected to have high zonal energy prices. This should result in as much\nenergy as possible being sold through an unrestricted zonal energy market, which could\nresult in a smaller total quantity of energy sold under the terms of the RMR contracts than\nunder the current intra-zonal congestion management protocols.\n         Under the ISO’s current congestion management protocols, the creation of new\ncongestion zones is unlikely to solve the incentives generation unit owners have to cause\nintra-zonal congestion, despite the fact that creating a new zone transforms some intra-\nzonal paths into inter-zonal paths. However, there will still be intra-zonal paths that are\nsusceptible to congestion using the strategies described above. Consequently, short of\nmoving to a full nodal-pricing model for energy and ancillary services in the California\nmarket, some RMR units are necessary to solve the local market power problems in the\nday-ahead or real-time markets due to either intra-zonal congestion or local grid\nreliability concerns. In addition, due the increased market power opportunities in small\nmarkets, it is not clear that a full nodal-pricing model for the California market would\n                         MSC Report,

[122] "mitigate the market power problems associated high ISO load periods more efficiently\nthat the current California zonal market would do with RMR units used in this manner.\n        In light of the above discussion, it is appropriate to think of RMR units as\nproviding liquidity to the zonal energy and ancillary services markets. By supplying\nenergy at certain points in the grid from RMR units and other units the firm owns, it can\nincrease the likelihood that an unrestricted market for energy and ancillary services can\noperate within the zone. This generator is compensated for providing this liquidity\nthrough the fixed payment it receives as an RMR unit owner. Allowing competition from\nPTOs (in the form of transmission upgrades), existing loads and generation, and new\ngeneration entrants to provide a portion or all of this local reliability service, should yield\na market-determined up-front payment, which pays for the cost of providing this liquidity\nto the market.\n        This designation of RMR units as market liquidity providers unifies their use for\nboth local grid reliability and intra-zonal congestion mitigation during times when the\nunrestricted zonal energy market does not clear. By facing these unit owners with risk of\nan RMR call at a cost-based rate to mitigate intra-zonal congestion, gives them strong\nincentives to reduce the likelihood of intra-zonal congestion particularly in the periods\nwhen zonal energy prices are likely to high. Zonal energy prices are likely to be high\nparticularly during the periods when total ISO load is high, so that this scheme provides\nthe greatest incentives to eliminate intra-zonal congestion during periods when the\nincentives other market participants have cause intra-zonal congestion are greatest. In\nexchange for taking on the task of eliminating intra-zonal congestion, RMR unit owners\nare paid an up-front annual payment which is determined through a competitive bidding\nprocess.\n                2.      Market-Based Intra-zonal Congestion Management Scheme\n        The second proposed intra-zonal congestion management scheme treats\ndecremental energy supplied for congestion mitigation as if it was a deviation from the\ngenerator’s hour-ahead schedule. All decremental measures taken to relieve intra-zonal\ncongestion are settled at the ex-post hourly real-time price. During any period when the\nunrestricted zonal incremental energy market fails to clear (bids must be skipped over to\nrelieve intra-zonal congestion), incremental energy would be provided by RMR unit\nowners at their variable cost, similar to the previous proposal. However, if this RMR\nunit’s variable cost is above the current zonal price, then this variable cost will set the\nzonal market-clearing price. Under this proposal, decremental bids would be used to\ndetermine the order in which out-of-sequence bids are used to decrement units able to\nrelieve intra-zonal congestion.\n        This scheme provides very strong incentives for all market participants not to\nattempt play to the so-called decremental energy game described earlier. This is because\nall generators know that if they cause intra-zonal congestion and must be decremented,\nthere may be a corresponding generator in that zone who is incremented to maintain\nbalance within the zone. The ten-minute price must also be above this generator’s bid in\norder for it to be dispatched in unrestricted zonal market.

[123] "playing the decremental energy game faces a significant risk of having to buy back\nenergy at an ex post price that is significantly above the day-ahead energy price or other\nenergy price its day-ahead energy schedule was hedged at. In those instances when an\nout-of-bid-sequence call must be made for incremental energy, an RMR unit would\ninstead be used to provide this energy. Even in this case the decrementing generator\nfaces the risk that this RMR unit’s variable payment rate will set the zonal price.\n         The downside of this scheme is that because all intra-zonal congestion must be\nmitigated as imbalance energy and generators can only be called to supply energy if the\nreal-time price is above their bid price, there are concerns about the potential exercise of\nmarket power in the incremental energy market. However, existence of the RMR energy\nbackstop in the those instance when an out-of-bid-sequence call would be required for\nincremental energy limits the extent of market power than can be exercised to the\nvariable cost of the RMR unit owner able to relieve the intra-zonal congestion. In\naddition, working against this incentive of one or a small number of generators to\nexercise market power in selling real-time energy is the incentive of generators on the\ndecremental side of market who stand the risk of having buy back imbalance energy at\nthe real-time price. These market participants would like to reduce to the zonal price of\nenergy during that hour to reduce the costs of selling back their decremental energy.\nBecause every congested intra-zonal interface has generation on the other side of it, this\nscheme always has a market participant with an incentive to limit the likelihood of intra-\nzonal congestion.\n         F.     New Zone Creation Recommendation\n         The evidence presented earlier on the impact of zonal market clearing on ancillary\nservices prices argues in favor keeping as few zones as possible in the California market.\nImplementing either of the intra-zonal congestion mitigation recommendations described\nabove should significantly reduce the incidence of intra-zonal congestion, thus\neliminating the necessity of undertaking the costly process of creating a new congestion\nzone. Embarking on a new zone creation process for the Path 26 interface may solve this\nproblem at the expense of significant market power when there is inter-zonal congestion\non paths across the newly created zones. In addition, the ISO may ending up having to\ncreate more congestion zones in the near future as a result of more market participants\nbeing able to exploit the flaws in the current intra-zonal congestion management\nprotocols. A superior strategy seems to be to first implement a revised intra-zonal\ncongestion management protocol. Then monitor the incidence of intra-zonal congestion\nto determine if the creation of a new zone is necessary under these protocols. This\nstrategy eliminates the very significant risk of increased market power when there is\nnorth to south congestion across the zonal interface between NP26 described above.\n         Only if the ISO management and Board feels that the improvements in system\nreliability along Path 26 as result of creating a new zone significantly outweigh the\nincreased market power risks from creating a zone

[124] "        G.       New Generation Connection Policy Recommendation\n     As the above discussion has hopefully made clear, without changes to the current\nintra-zonal congestion management protocols, any new generation connection policy is\nnot likely to lead to the geographic distribution of new generation entry and transmission\nupgrades that will enhance the efficiency of the California electricity market.\nConsequently, it seems prudent to incorporate into any proposed new generation\nconnection policy a revised set of intra-zonal congestion management protocols. Without\na clear statement of these new congestion management protocols, it will be extremely\ndifficult to assess the efficiency properties of any new generation connection policy.\n     To this end, it our understanding that the ISO management is in the process of\nformulating revised intra-zonal congestion management protocols that are largely\nconsistent with the recommendations for revising the existing intra-zonal congestion\nmanagement protocols given above, and these protocols will be included in its New\nGeneration Connection Policy filing.\n10.     Transmission Pricing and Firm Transmission Rights (FTRs)\n     We continue to have concerns about the release of FTRs with scheduling priority for\nall available capacity, as required by the FERC in its May 3, 1999 order. Such FTRs are\nnot required in order for market participants to be able to hedge congestion risks; such\nhedging can occur using purely financial transactions. The release of this magnitude of\nFTRs also will tend to make the ISO's markets for inter-zonal congestion, using\nadjustment bids, thinner and more volatile. Furthermore, the concentrated ownership of\nFTRs with scheduling priority could well enable some companies to obtain market power\nover transmission rights, with adverse implications for energy markets themselves.\n     Given that plans are well along for the release of these FTRs with scheduling priority,\nwe strongly favor imposing position limits on these FTRs. Position limits are ultimately\na way of preventing any one entity from assembling a dominant position in the provision\nof transmission over a congested interface, with the market power dangers attendant to\nsuch a position. Put simply, we regard it as prudent to begin the FTR experience by\nflatly prohibiting the monopolization of FTRs that include scheduling priority. Indeed, if\na dominant position in FTRs would yield genuine market power, economic theory warns\nthat a single player would have the incentive to assemble just such a position, to the\ndetriment of those who are likely to require transmission across the interface during\ncongested period of time. With a position limit equal to 40% of the available\ntransmission capacity, for example, we do not believe that legitimate business uses of\nFTRs are likely to be blocked in any significant way, yet no one company could assemble\na dominant FTR holding on a specific interface.\n     We realize that a imposing position limits requires a certain degree of monitoring and\nreporting regarding FTRs. Certainly, meaningful compliance would require monitoring\nof the secondary market for FTRs, not just the transactions associated with the initial\nrelease of FTRs.

[125] "to self-reporting, with the ISO performing after-the-fact verification of the accuracy of\nsuch reports, imposing penalties and sanctions in cases of non-compliance. It is our\nunderstanding that with self-policing and after-the-fact verification of compliance,\ninformation from the ISO's Secondary Registration System (SRS) could be used with few\nchanges or additions.\n     We will, of course, have more to say about FTRs by December 1, 2000, when the\nFERC has instructed us to file a report on the experience with FTRs. Certainly we will\nbe better able to assess the impact of FTRs if we are able to monitor FTR holdings. We\nalso hope to observe how FTRs are being used, to determine whether in fact there are\nlegitimate business purposes that might require relatively concentrated holdings, e.g., in\nexcess of 40% of the available transmission capacity.\n     We realize that possible abuses of FTRs are just that—possible but not proven, and\nperhaps not even all that likely. But our experience with the transition to competitive\nmarkets to date has shown us that many market participants are sophisticated and quite\nable to maximize their profits subject the regulatory rules constraining their behavior.\nBecause we see no compelling reason why large assemblages of FTRs are needed, and\nbecause we remain relatively ignorant of how these FTRs will actually be used, we\nbelieve that California consumers will be best served by at least starting the FTR release\nwith meaningful position limits and reporting requirements in place.\n11.       PG&E Divestiture\n     PG&E controls over 4,500 MW of hydroelectric capacity in Northern California of\nwhich approximately 3,500 MW is subject to divestiture. This capacity spans five major\nwatersheds and includes the 1,200 MW Helms pumped storage plant. As a number of\nobservers have pointed out, this capacity is an extraordinarily valuable asset both for\nPG&E and for the electric power system in California. PG&E ownership of the hydro\nsystem, even after divestiture of its fossil units, is sufficient to give it market power over\nprovision of ancillary services under certain load conditions, and over PX energy prices\nwhen transmission paths into Northern California are constrained. At present, PG&E has\nstrong incentives to use its hydro capacity to constrain rather than raise prices, because it\nis still subject to the rate freeze and CTC recovery mechanism. However, once the hydro\nassets are divested under California’s restructuring plan, the new owner or owners will\nhave every incentive to do the opposite, potentially exacerbating volatility and above-\ncompetitive prices in these already concentrated markets.\n     A number of competing proposals have been advanced by PG&E and others for\ndivesting the hydro system. PG&E originally proposed to divest the major part of the\nsystem to an unregulated subsidiary. The California legislature has not accepted this\nproposal and PG&E reportedly is proceeding to sell the system off to unaffiliated buyers.\n     The timing and terms of the sale are important to the successful functioning of the\nNorthern California power market.

[126] "balance of PG&E’s CTC account and reduce the time until a more competitive retail\nmarket in PG&E’s service area exists by hastening the of end PG&E’s CTC recovery and\nrate freeze period.\n          The terms of the divestiture transaction are equally important. As the ISO’s\nDepartment of Market Analysis has pointed out, selling the assets to a single buyer or to a\nbuyer that owns other fossil-generating units in Northern California, can increase the\nlikelihood that generation owners can exercise market power in the ancillary services\nmarkets. (The DMA paper is attached as Appendix B). The DMA suggests alternative\nstructural, contractual and “behavioral” measures to migrate potential exercise of market\npower. The Committee concurs in the DMA’s assessment that the terms of this\ndivestiture (which ultimately will have to be approved by the Commission under §§ 8\nand 203 of the Federal Power Act) are critical to the functioning of California’s ancillary\nservices markets, and that effective market power mitigation measures must be put in\nplace. The Committee’s view is that “behavioral” mitigation measures (such as bidding\nrules and minimum capacity availability requirements) are complex and difficult to\nenforce. Structural mitigation measures, such as a requirement that the hydroelectric\nsystems be sold off on a watershed-by-watershed basis to separate companies that are\nindependent of major owners of Northern California generation, are better designed to\neffectively mitigate market power, and are the preferred coverage. For this reason we\nstrongly recommend the assets be divested on a watershed-by-watershed basis to a buyer\nunaffiliated with PG&E or other major generation owners in Northern California.\nStructured in this manner, the divestiture of PG&E’s hydro system can decrease, rather\nthan increase market power in California’s wholesale electricity market.\n12.       Maximum Purchase Price Caps\n     The Commission’s May 26 Order (Redondo Beach Docket No. ER98-2843-005 et.\nal., May 26, 1999) allows the ISO to retain its current authority to set maximum prices at\nwhich it will purchase ancillary services and imbalance energy only until November 15,\n1999. After that date, the ISO’s authority to set maximum purchase prices, which the\nOrder refers to as “price caps”, will be eliminated.19 The ISO sought rehearing of the\nMay 26 Order and on September 17, 1999, filed tariff amendments which; if approved,\nwould extend the maximum purchase price authority until through November 15, 2000.\nOn August 26, 1999, the ISO Board also took action under its existing maximum\npurchase price authority to increase the price limits on ancillary services from $250 to\n$750 effective October 1, 1999. If its authority is extended for 12 months as requested,\nthe price limits will stay at this level unless the ISO makes a subsequent determination to\nchange them.\n19\n   The term “price cap” may be a misnomer since it is authorization for the ISO to decline to purchase\nancillary services and real-time energy when bid prices exceed a particular level, not a limit on what\ngenerator can bid into the market. When the ISO sets maximum purchase prices, it specifies the highest\nprice it will pay for ancillary services. Generators are free to sell real-time energy or ancillary services at a\nhigher price if they can find a buyer (such as a self-providing SC or an out-of-state purchaser).\n

[127] "      On June 24, 1999, the ISO’s Market Surveillance Committee and the PX Market\nMonitoring Committee (“MMC”) submitted a joint memorandum to the ISO and PX in\nwhich the two Committees stated that they concurred with the FERC that the then-current\n$250 purchase-price limits on ancillary services and imbalance energy should be raised as\nsoon as possible consistent with the maintenance of competitive markets for electricity in\nCalifornia. The Committees stated, however, that they strongly believed that the price\ncaps should not be raised until the ISO’s redesign of its ancillary services markets and the\nreform of the Reliability Must-Run (“RMR”) contracts were fully implemented. In their\nview, setting a date certain for the removal of the price caps that is independent of the\ncompletion of these necessary redesign and reform efforts, leaves the California markets\nunprotected from massive unanticipated price movements that could arise from market-\ndesign flaws or the exercise of market power.20\n      The MSC has been extremely reluctant to recommend imposing purchase-price caps\non the energy and ancillary-services markets in California. However, we continue to\nhave concerns about the competitiveness of the California energy and ancillary-services\nmarkets, as we have detailed in Sections 3 and 4 of this report. For that reason, we\nbelieve that until the market-design problems identified in our prior reports are remedied\nand it is clear that any remaining generator market power has been mitigated, purchase-\nprice limits should be retained on the imbalance-energy and ancillary-services markets.\nThe Committee also believes that until there is sufficient confidence that the structure of\nthe California wholesale electricity market allows unrestricted market forces to yield\nefficient results, there will still be a need for a maximum purchase price limitation or\nother mechanism by which the ISO and the PX can facilitate the smooth functioning of\nthe market and protect California consumers from inefficiently high prices for energy and\nancillary services.\n      As the MSC has emphasized in this report and in its August 1998 and March 1999\nreports to the FERC, the California markets for energy and ancillary services are highly\ninterdependent. In particular, given the sequential structure of the California electricity\nmarkets, expectations about prices in the ancillary-services markets have a major impact\non prices in the PX day-ahead market, and the expected price for imbalance energy has\nstrong effects on the energy prices in both the PX day-ahead and day-of markets.\nConsequently, the PX is heavily dependent on the ISO’s authority to establish maximum\nprices that it will pay for real-time energy, and on the ISO’s exercise of any such\nauthority. Since a price limit in the ISO real-time energy market will effectively serve as\na price constraint on the PX day-ahead and day-of energy markets, the ISO’s authority to\nestablish maximum purchase prices for ancillary services and imbalance energy protects\nboth sets of markets.\n20\n   The Committees also stated that the specific choice of a November 15, 1999 termination date was\nespecially problematic because the second stage of the RMR reform cannot be completed before December\n1st, even if the ISO files the necessary changes on the earliest date it can, October 1st, because of the

[128] "    Finally, although the California electricity market is unique in some respects, the\nMSC believes that the issues of market-supporting interventions that now face the ISO\nand the PX in California have arisen and will continue to arise in other newly deregulated\nelectricity markets that are emerging in other parts of the U.S., particularly in New\nEngland. The Committee believes that the FERC should deal with these questions now\nin a way that will have general application and not wait to address these issues in the\ncontext of emergency situations that are very likely to arise in different jurisdictions.\n    In the remainder of this section we discuss the need for market protecting\ninterventions and, in particular, the basis of our recommendations to retain for the next 12\nmonths, the maximum purchase price limits for ancillary services and imbalance energy\nin the California electricity markets.\n        A.      The Role of Purchase-Price Caps\n        With a strong consensus among market participants that all the flaws in the design\nof the markets for energy and ancillary service had been eliminated, with a large number\nof consumers purchasing energy or ancillary services at the hourly spot price, and with a\nfairly full and robust set of forward and financial contracts available to market\nparticipants, there would be very little reason to consider price-intervention mechanisms\nin the California electricity market. But the California market presently falls far short of\nthis. In the near term, until the market-design problems that have already been identified\nare remedied, there is a continuing need for the ISO to have authority to set maximum\npurchase prices. In the longer term, when those design flaws are corrected but price\nresponsive demand and robust markets for forward and financial contracts are not yet\nfully developed, the ISO will still need a mechanism to ensure orderly and efficient\nmarkets for energy and ancillary services. That is, once the current price caps are lifted,\nthe ISO must retain some residual authority to intervene during market emergencies to\nlimit the prices it will pay for energy and ancillary services.\n                1.       Market Flaws Remain\n        The California market for electricity has been in operation for 18 months.\nAlthough the Committee hopes that the most market-design flaws have been identified,\nonly experience with the new market design when all the necessary changes have been\nimplemented will enable us to determine whether more problems remain. Some flaws\ncreate opportunities that can produce extremely high prices, and without a damage-\ncontrol purchase-price caps, there is no limit to how high these prices could go.\n        If the ISO lacks the authority to limit the prices at which it purchases energy or\nancillary services, it will be forced as it was in July 1998 to accept bids of $5,000 or\n$9,999 per MWh for ancillary service, even in times of moderate demand and ample\nsupply. A market perturbation in thin ancillary services markets -- such as the one that\noccurred on May 30, 1999–could have extraordinary impacts on prices and costs. In that\ncase, the unavailability of one large hydroelectric facility drove regulation prices to $250\nfor 10 hours. For those 10 hours, regulation capacity costs totaled $4.1 million.

[129] "market had cleared at $5000 as it did on July 9, 1998, California consumers would have\nhad to pay 20 times more than they did for the service. This would come to more than\n$80 million for one day. Had the market cleared at $9,999 (as it did on July 13, 1998),\nthe cost to consumers would have been almost 40 times more than it was. Market\nperturbations in the broader PX markets, such as the one that occurred on October 1,\n1999, and is described in Section 3, can have even greater consumer cost impacts.\n        The Commission’s May 26th Order leaves the ISO with no residual authority to\ncope immediately and directly with severe market perturbations that may occur after\nNovember 15th. Unless the Order is modified, it effectively requires the ISO to return to\nthe FERC to seek remedial authority after any problem occurs. By the time the\nCommission acts on such a request, California consumers may have incurred many\nhundreds of millions of dollars in higher energy costs.\n                2.      The Importance of Price-Responsive Final Demand\n        As we discuss throughout this report, an essential element of a smoothly\nfunctioning competitive market for electricity is a price-responsive demand-side of the\nmarket. When final customers--residential, commercial, and industrial--can respond in\nreal-time to spot prices for energy and ancillary services, the market itself provides an\nappropriate and effective check on the ability of supply-side participants to raise prices to\ninefficient levels. Until the demand-side of the market becomes much more price\nresponsive, there need to be other checks on the exploitation of market-design flaws and\nthe exercise of market power; market-intervention measures by the ISO are a prime\ncandidate.\n                3.      The Need for Forward Contracts\n        The current California market rules present various impediments to consumers\nwho might try to set an implicit purchase-price cap in the energy and ancillary services\nmarket through creative financial forward-contracting schemes, just as those rules\ndiminish the effects of actions by those who might financially benefit from shifting their\nconsumption in response to hourly electricity prices. Consequently, without some\nchanges in these market rules and some period of time to adjust to such changes, it would\nbe inadvisable to remove the ISO’s ability to invoke some damage-control market\nintervention in its energy and ancillary services markets.\n                4.      Legal Sufficiency\n        Because it leaves California consumers unprotected from exercise of market\npower by generators selling into the state’s electric power market, the Commission’s\ncurrent policy with respect to maximum purchase price raises fundamental questions of\nlegal sufficiency. All generators in California (other than Federal and state agencies and\nmunicipalities) that sell energy or ancillary services to the ISO or PX are “public utilities”\nunder the Federal Power Act because they make sales for resale in interstate commerce.\n16 U.S.C. § 824(e). Under §§ 205 and 206 of the FPA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 824d and 824e, the\nprices at which these sales are made must be “just and reasonable.” The Commission has\nremoved cost-based price caps on these

[130] "market power over generation or transmission and cannot erect other barriers to entry by\ncompeting generators.21 If the Committee’s analysis presented in this report is correct, the\npredicate for allowing market-based rates may be incorrect. The Committee’s analysis\nindicates generators are capable of exercising market power at certain times in some\nmarkets. Under well established precedent, seller rates need not be regulated if, but only\nif, regulation of the buyer is sufficient to ensure just and reasonable rates. FPC v. Texaco\nInc., 417 U.S. 330 (1974). For that reason, in a circumstance where sellers have market\npower, the Commission need not regulate the sellers rates directly by imposing cost-\nbased price caps on the sellers, so long as it can assure itself that buyers will be able to\ndiscipline sellers’ market power. Giving buyers (in this case the ISO and PX) authority\nto impose maximum purchase price limits is one mechanism for doing so. However, we\nfail to see how the Commission, in the face of significant evidence of the exercise of\nmarket power by generators in the California markets, can remove all price caps on\nsellers and at the same time disable the ISO as buyer, from protecting itself and\nCalifornia consumers from the exercise of seller market power. The Supreme Court in\nthe Texaco case reiterated that no particular rate-making methodology is required under\nthe just and reasonable standard of the Natural Gas Act. Texaco 417 U.S. at 338. That\nstandard is identical to the just and reasonable standard in §§ 205 and 206 of the Federal\nPower Act. Under both statutes, the Commission and the courts look to the end result.\nFPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 602 (1944).22\n         According to legal analysis provided to the MSC, the Commission cannot\nlawfully abandon its statutory duty to assure that the mechanisms it adopts result in just\nand reasonable rates under FPA §§ 205 and 206. It has no general authority to waive this\nfundamental requirement. Market- based rates can be consistent with the statute only in\nthe absence of market power. Thus, “[t]he Commission allows power sales at market-\nbased rates if the seller and its affiliates do not have, or have adequately mitigated,\nmarket power in generation and transmission and cannot erect other barriers to entry.”23\nThis approach is endorsed by the courts. Cajun Elec. Power v. FERC, 28 F.3d 173, 176\n(D.C. Cir. 1994); Elizabethtown Gas Co. v. FERC, 10 F.3d 866, 870 (D.C. Cir. 1993).\nThe Commission acts unlawfully, however, if it seeks to stimulate supply “by sales freed\nfrom meaningful regulation”24 that do not assure just and reasonable rates. FPC v.\nTexaco, supra; cf. Farmers Union Cent. Exchange, Inc. v. FERC, 734 F.2d 1486, 1502-\n1504 (D.C. Cir. 1984). (“. . .

[131] "       Here, the opportunities for the exercise of market power, will, in the absence of\nprice caps, produce unjust and unreasonable rates in violation of the statutory standard.\nAs this report points out, in July of 1999 total wholesale energy purchase costs were\nestimated to be 20% in excess of the pure competitive market benchmark.\n               5.      Position on Board Action\n       The Committee is strongly of the view that the ISO needs continuing authority to\nimpose maximum purchase price limits and at least temporarily to keep the current limits\nin place. For that reason, the Committee supports the ISO’s September 15 tariff filing\nand most elements of the ISO Governing Board’s August 26, 1999, price cap resolution.\nUnder that resolution:\n       1.      The price caps in Ancillary Service and Imbalance Energy markets would\n               be raised from $250 to $750 (per MW or MWh, respectively), effective\n               September 30, 1999;\n       2.      The price caps will be reduced to $500 effective June 1, 2000 if the ISO\n               Governing Board determines, based on a report from ISO management,\n               that:\n               (a)     the markets are not workably competitive;\n               (b)     there are not practicable demand side management options in\n                       place; or\n               (c)     the IOU Utility Distribution Companies have sought and not\n                       obtained practicable options to self-provide Ancillary Services and\n                       applicable hedging products in the Power Exchange consistent\n                       with California Public Utilities Commission Preferred Policy\n                       Decisions;\n       3.      ISO Management is authorized to lower price caps in a market without\n               Board action upon Management’s assessment that the affected market is\n               not workably competitive, provide that Management promptly notifies the\n               Board of its action and presents supporting analysis to the Board (the\n               Safety Net”); and\n       4.

The Committee supports the ISO’s request for a one-year extension of its\n                   authority to maintain maximum purchase prices, and its increase of\n                   maximum purchase prices from $250 to $750 effective October 1, 1999.\n                   The caps should be left at this level for a full 12 months unless the ISO\n                   exercises Safety Net authority to lower them.\n         3.        The Committee supports the ISO’s Safety Net recommendation – (the\n                   ability of the ISO management to lower caps temporarily to deal with\n                   market disruptions).\n         4.        The ISO should review the need to continue maximum purchase price\n                   limits after the summer of 2000.\n         5.        Even if maximum purchase price limits are ended after summer of 2000,\n                   the ISO should retain “safety net authority” thereafter.\n13.      Workable Competition and New Zone Creation\n     Our ultimate aim is to help assure that the various electricity markets25 in California\nperform in an efficient fashion, bringing reliable electricity to consumers at least cost\nover the long run. If these inter-related markets are as close to this ideal as can be\nexpected in practice, we say they are “workably competitive.” The concept of a market\nbeing “workably competitive” is clear enough: we do not expect “perfect competition,”\ni.e., price-taking behavior by all market participants, but neither does any one firm enjoy\nsignificant market power; nor is there collusion permitting the collective exercise of\nmarket power. But how is this concept to be made operational in California’s electricity\nmarkets?\n     Beyond the general interest in assessing whether competition is “working” in\nCalifornia’s electricity markets, for the purposes of creating new zones to manage\ncongestion, the ISO is required to assess whether the market for electricity generation in\neach of the two new proposed zones is “workably competitive” a substantial portion of\nthe time. We indicate here the steps we believe should be followed in making such an\nassessment.\n         A.        General Principles\n         In a market for a homogeneous good such as electricity, the ideal of perfect\ncompetition is easily defined: each supplier, acting independently and lacking the ability\nto affect the market-clearing price, maximizes its own profits by bidding in its generating\nunits at marginal cost. Likewise, each buyer, also acting independently and lacking the\nability to affect the market-clearing price, bids in its demand at its willingness-to-pay.26\n25\n   The principles articulated here apply equally to markets for ancillary services, or transmission rights for\nthat matter, to markets for energy itself.\n26\n   Even if the supply side of a market is highly competitive, the buyer(s) could still exert monopsony\npower. Under perfect competition, both buyers and sellers are price-takers.\n                             MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 131 of 148\n"

[133] "The resulting equilibrium prices and quantities are efficient in two senses: (1) least-cost\nproduction of the electricity that is actually produced, and (2) the quantity of electricity\nmaximizes total net value (benefits to buyers less cost of production).\n          In practice, this ideal can only be approached, raising the question of how “close”\na given market must be to the ideal for us to declare victory and characterize that market\nas “workably competitive.” Economists have been grappling with the concept of\n“workable competition” for over 50 years, and have yet to identify a set of diagnostics\nthat can be applied to determine reliably whether or not a market is in fact “workably\ncompetitive.”\n          While some market participants and observers may seek a simple formula or\nbright-line test to determine whether an electricity market is “workably competitive,” we\ndo not believe that any formulaic approach is likely to be reliable. Just as the Department\nof Justice and the Federal Trade Commission regard market shares as a starting point for\nevaluating the effects of horizontal mergers, not the end of the analysis, we favor an\napproach that looks at a variety of market indices, and may incorporate substantial\ninstitutional detail, for assessing the state of competition in a given electricity market.\n          This is not to say that the proper inquiry is unpredictable or unfocused. To the\ncontrary, we believe that research findings and practical experience from both antitrust\nand regulatory spheres provide substantial guidance for assessing the state of competition\nin a given electricity market.27 Drawing on that body of knowledge, and on our own\nexperience evaluating competitive conditions, we sketch here some of the key questions\nthat we believe should be addressed when determining whether a given electricity market\nis “workably competitive.28” We express these tests through a list of (cumulative)\nconditions that tend to support a conclusion that a given electricity market is “workably\ncompetitive.” This list is intentionally designed to apply to short-term bidding markets\nfor a homogeneous good subject to substantial fluctuations demand, in which a market-\nclearing price (MCP) is determined through the equating of supply and demand.\n          B.       Significant Quantity is Bid But Not Called\n          If there is a “thick” stack of bids at prices just above the MCP, it is unlikely that\nany single supplier can exert meaningful control over price. If Supplier X were to\nattempt to withhold its capacity, or raise its bid, the MCP would change little if at all:\nSupplier X’s electricity (or capacity) would simply be replaced with electricity (or\ncapacity) bid by others at or near the MCP.\n27\n   See Severin Borenstein, “Understanding Competitive Pricing and Market Power in Wholesale Electricity\nMarkets,” University of California Energy Institute, August 1999, for a well-reasoned discussion of pricing\nand investment decisions in competitive electricity markets.\n28\n   We focus here on “workable competition” among suppliers, assuming that monopsony power is not a\nsignificant problem, either because demand is unconcentrated or because buyers are unable to reduce\ndemand to depress prices. However, the same principles developed here can be used to assess buyer power\nin electricity markets.\n                            MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 132 of 148\n"

[134] "          For a given set of bids by suppliers, it is relatively straightforward to determine\nthe (residual) demand curve facing any given supplier: if that supplier raised its bids, or\nreduced its supply, what would be the impact on market price? In general, if a single\nsupplier (a) has a significant market share, and (b) has the ability to materially affect the\nMCP through its bidding behavior, that supplier is likely to possess some meaningful\nmarket power. Using bid data, the ability of any single market participant to elevate the\nMCP can be directly estimated.\n          The ISO’s Department of Market Analysis (DMA) has developed a summary\nmeasure, called the “Residual Supply Index” (“RSI”), that partially captures the\n“thickness” of the stack of bids above the MCP. (See Annual Report on Market Issues\nand Performance, California ISO, June 1999, pages 7-4 through 7-20.) Define “Bid\nSufficiency,” B, as the ratio of total quantity bid (at the highest allowable price) to the\ntotal quantity demanded (taken as fixed, i.e., independent of price). Define the “share of\nsupplier X,” SX, as the quantity bid by supplier X as a fraction of total demand. The RSI\nfor a given supplier is then defined as RSIX = B - SX. The RSI is meant to capture the\nsufficiency of suppliers other than X to meet demand. A high value of RSIX thus tends to\nindicate that supplier X lacks market power.\n          We agree with the DMA that their RSI can be a useful way of summarizing “bid\nsufficiency” in a given electricity market at a given point in time. However, we should\npoint out that a high value of RSI may be consistent with significant market power if the\nsupply bids are well above the MCP. For this reason, the RSI seems better suited to\nevaluating whether the market is in danger of not clearing at all (due to bid insufficiency)\nrather than assessing the degree of market power of any individual supplier.29 Put\ndifferently, there is no reason to restrict attention to a summary measure such as the RSI\nfor the purpose of assessing market power when we have available the full set of bids.\nWe believe that this is also the position of the DMA, which proposes to use the RSI for\nscreening purposes when the information, the resources, or the time is not available to\nconduct an in-depth study of market power. DMA has also proposed a refinement which\nwill examine RSI for bids under certain price level, such as $100/MWh. This can help to\naddress the question whether the supply bids are well above MCP.\n          C.       Bids are Close to Marginal Cost\n          The strongest single piece of evidence that a given supplier lacks market power is\nthe observation that this supplier bids its energy and/or capacity into the market at or near\n29\n   The DMA offers a classification system (see p. 7-4) in which a Bid Sufficiency of greater than 150%\nindicates “Low Potential Market Power.” While we agree that the RSI can be a useful and practical\nindicator of likely market power, and an RSI of greater than 150% may in practice be highly correlated\nwith the absence of significant market power, we would prefer to look directly at the thickness of bids just\nat or above the MCP. Situations could arise in which there is ample Bid Sufficiency, but the rejected bids\nare well above the MCP. In this situation, one or more suppliers could indeed enjoy significant market\npower. Of course, if for some reason information about the level of bids above the MCP were not\navailable, but the total quantity bid were available, the RSI could be observed, but not the ability of any\nindividual bidder to elevate the MCP; in this situation, the RSI could well be the best observable measure\nof likely market power.\n                             MSC Report, October 18, 1999,

[135] "its marginal cost.30 Although we can readily observe bids in California’s electricity\nmarkets, we may have some difficulty comparing these bids to marginal cost if the latter\nis difficult to observe or estimate.\n         If a supplier bids some or all of its capacity into the market well above marginal\ncost, we ask ourselves why such a bid was more profitable than bidding at, or slightly\nabove, marginal cost. The most likely answer is that this supplier believed it could (with\nsome likelihood) cause the marginal to rise by raising its own bids. The larger is the\nsupplier’s share of the market, and the larger is the gap between the supplier’s marginal\ncost and its bid, the greater is the inference of market power.\n         We hasten to add that we do not in any sense regard such bidding as\nobjectionable; its is merely the result of profit-maximization by the supplier possessing\nsome power over price (at least probabilistically). But the observation, or inference, that\nthis supplier (and perhaps others) enjoys market power may well be relevant for policy\ndecisions such as the lifting of a price cap or the creation of a new zone.\n         We also should emphasize that we would expect suppliers lacking market power\nto bid at marginal cost even during periods of peak demand. What is different during\npeak periods is that more costly units (as measured by marginal cost) are active, which\nrequires a higher MCP. Units with lower marginal costs will thus enjoy the largest\nmargins (between MCP and marginal cost) during these periods. Naturally, the\nfrequency and intensity of these peak periods affects investment incentives.\n         Some commentators have pointed out that in many markets firms are unable to\nrecover their fixed costs if they price at marginal cost, suggesting therefore that to view\nprices in excess of marginal cost as indicative of market power must be faulty. We have\ntwo main responses to this assertion. First, the mere fact that a supplier bids marginal\ncost does not been that the price received by this supplier equals marginal cost. To the\ncontrary, the MCP exceeds the bids of all suppliers except the marginal supplier(s), i.e.,\nthose with the highest bids that are accepted. So most suppliers most of the time will\nreceive a margin equal to the gap between the MCP and their marginal cost (which equals\ntheir bid) under competitive conditions. Second, in many other markets where a\nsupplier’s bid indeed determines the price it receives, we have differentiated products, so\nindividual firms are not price-takers. It is usually recognized that these firms—from\nrestaurants to manufacturers of branded consumer goods to publishers of movies and\ncomputer software—indeed have some technical market power (but usually not any\nmeaningful market power for antitrust purposes), and that this is a necessary reward for\nincurring the fixed costs necessary to produce a differentiated product valued by\nconsumers. We do not explore this point further here as the markets of concern to us\ninvolve homogeneous goods; we merely wish to point out that drawing analogies\nbetween bidding markets for a homogeneous good and posted-price markets for\ndifferentiated products is perilous.\n30\n   By “marginal cost” we mean the true (economic, not accounting) incremental cost of fulfilling the bid.\nFor a supplier that is capacity-constrained, the marginal cost may be an opportunity cost, e.g., of not selling\nthat same power or capacity in another market.\n                             MSC Report, October 18, 1999,

[136] "          D.        Supply is Not Concentrated\n          Market concentration is the single most commonly-used measure of whether a\nmarket is “competitive” or not. In many antitrust cases, for example, including both\nmergers and monopolization cases, both the antitrust enforcement agencies and the\nCourts look to market shares as a measure of market power.\nWe certainly believe that market shares, and market concentration, are important\nmeasures in electricity markets as well. However, we would like to stress that market\nshares are usually employed as a proxy for market power because the direct measurement\nof market power is difficult or impossible with available data. Happily, we have\nexcellent data about prices and quantities in California’s electricity markets. So, we\nregard market shares as a useful additional measure, but not the very best available\nmeasure of market power in California’s electricity markets. Our preferred measures are\nthose two indicated just above: the “thickness” of bids at or just above the MCP, and the\n(percentage) gap between various suppliers’ bids and their marginal costs.31\n          E.        Buyers are Flexible\n          Market power by sellers is inevitably reduced if buyers have the flexibility to\nreduce their demand in the presence of high prices and/or to turn to other sources of\nsupply (either a substitute product or the same product provided from a different\ngeographic area).\n          So far, wholesale buyers of electricity in California have sadly little ability to\nreduce demand in the presence of high prices. And the ISO has very little ability to\nreduce its demand for ancillary services or real-time energy given its duty to meet various\nreserve requirements and assure grid reliability. The fact that demand is extremely\ninelastic (insensitive to price) in the short run in most of California’s electricity markets\nis arguably the single most important factor preventing these markets from being\n“workably competitive.”\n          F.        There Are No Unnecessary Institutional Barriers to Rivalry or\n                    to Demand Flexibility\n          Given the elaborate regulatory regime in place in California’s electricity markets,\nit is all too easy for regulations to impede “workable competition.” We have previously\nexpressed concerns about the Reliability-Must-Run rules and the impact they have on\nbidding behavior; hopefully the new arrangement for RMRs will greatly alleviate those\n31\n   Having said this, we hasten to add that we expect firms with relatively large market shares to be precisely\nthe ones that enjoy and exercise market power. Basic economics tells us that the optimal markup of price\n(bid) over marginal cost depends directly upon the number of “infra-marginal” units sold by the supplier in\nquestion, i.e., units of output that would be sold at a slightly lower bid. The number of such units can be\nconsidered proportional to the supplier’s market share. However, a supplier with a small market share\ncould have power over price if that supplier is the marginal supplier (at the MCP) and there are few bids\njust above the MCP.\n

[137] "concerns. We have previously expressed concerns that the tariff governing the ISO has\nlimited the ISO’s flexibility as a buyer of ancillary services and thus made it harder for\ncompetition to work; hopefully the new “Rational Buyer Protocols” will go far to address\nthose concerns. But these are merely two examples of how various institutional rules or\nregulations can serve to exacerbate market power problems. Generally speaking, an\nassessment of whether a market is “workably competitive” will include an evaluation of\nwhether there are institutional features that reduce rivalry among actual and potential\nsuppliers, or than hinder buyer flexibility.\n         G.     Collusion is Difficult\n         Collusion has no place in a “workably competitive” market. If collusion is easily\nachieved, or at least a dangerous probability (e.g., because of a concentrated market\nstructure or because the suppliers have ample opportunities to meet and reach illegal\nagreements), a market may fail to be “workably competitive.” To date, we are not aware\nthat collusion has been a major problem in California’s electricity markets, but\nconsumers, regulators, and the California and Federal antitrust agencies must, as always,\nbe vigilant about detecting and punishing any price fixing or market division agreements.\n         H.     Entry into the Market is Easy\n         The final factor that should be considered in evaluating whether a market is\n“workably competitive” is the ease of entry into that market. In California’s electricity\nmarkets, we would expect entry typically to come in one of two ways: (1) the supply of\nenergy or ancillary services from outside the State (these suppliers would just as well be\ncalled market participants as “entrants”), and (2) the construction of new generation\nfacilities. Evaluation of these two types of entry is quite distinct. The ability of imports\nto come in California in increasing quantities as needed is the key to evaluating that type\nof entry. And the entry obstacles and costs faced by new generators are key to the second\ntype of entry. Of course, entry by new generators is more likely to undermine market\npower in the long run than in the short run.\n         I.     Application to the Creation of New Zones\n         Section 7.2.7 of the ISO Tariff contains provisions for the creation, modification,\nand elimination of zones. The Tariff lists two main necessary conditions for the creation\nof a new zone within an existing zone: (1) the presence of significant congestion on a\npath within that zone; and (2) the existence of workably competitive generation markets\non both sides of the corresponding interface for a substantial period of the year.\n         As an example, intra-zonal congestion on Path 26 recently satisfied the first\ncriterion for the creation of a new zone. Thus, it became necessary to assess whether\ngeneration markets on both sides of Path 26 were in fact “workably competitive.”\n         Applying the methodology above to this example, we would look at the demand\nand supply of energy and ancillary services on both sides of Path 26 to see if there were a\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 136 of 148\n"

[138] "“thick” set of bids just above the MCP, after segregating supply and demand on the two\nsides of Path 26. We would also look at the margins between bids and (estimates of)\nmarginal cost for generators on both sides of Path 26.\n    Both of these tests can be conducted under various load and congestion conditions.\nFor example, conditions may vary depending not only upon load but upon the presence,\ndegree, or direction of congestion on Path 15.\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999,

[139] "14.     Appendix A\n       ISO MARKET SURVEILLANCE COMMITTEE OPINION ON FIRM\n                         TRANSMISSION RIGHTS PROPOSALS\n        The Market Surveillance Committee (Frank Wolak and Carl Shapiro), and its\nadvisors (Robert Wilson, and James Bushnell) have analyzed the current two proposals\nfor the creation of firm transmission rights (FTRs) for the California electricity market.\n        It is the opinion of the Committee that the issuance of a set of FTRs with an\naggregate capacity equal to 100% of the current physical capacity of the system could\npotentially lead to several serious, negative consequences to electricity consumers in\nCalifornia. The committee is particularly concerned about the allocation of FTRs that\ninclude a scheduling priority to be invoked when the ISO adjustment markets do not\nclear. There is concern that an issuance of such rights equivalent to 100% of\ntransmission system capacity could eliminate the incentive of rights holders to participate\nin ISO congestion protocols and weaken the ability of the ISO to oversee the reliable\noperation of the transmission resources under its jurisdiction. Several negative\nconsequences may ensue from a marginalization of the ISO’s role in congestion\nmanagement:\n        1. The transparency of transmission prices could be seriously reduced or\n             eliminated. The lack of a transparent and reliable price signal for transmission\n             congestion could undermine the ability of both producers and consumers to\n             effectively participate in a regional market. Without clear signals about the\n             costs of moving power throughout the California grid, decisions about where\n             to locate new generation or what transmission paths should be upgraded and\n             when become extremely difficult to make. Market participants will be forced\n             to make decisions that affect congestion costs without a clear idea of what\n             these costs are.\n        2. The movement of the majority of transmission market transactions to\n             secondary, and perhaps non-transparent markets may seriously impede the\n             ability of the ISO and other institutions to monitor market abuses in\n             transmission, energy, and ancillary service markets. More importantly, the\n             ISO would lose the ability to monitor FTRs holdings, and therefore find it\n             significantly more difficult to detect the exercise of market power that arises\n             from concentrated holdings of FTRs, until that market power has actually\n             been used.\n        3. The potential lack of price-transparency and concentration of scheduling\n             priorities may lead many non-rights holding consumers and producers to shift\n             their scheduling decisions from day-ahead markets to real-time markets.\n             Significant differences between day-ahead schedules and real time operations\n                         MSC Report, October 18,

[140] "            would place increased strain on the ISO’s ability to maintain reliability in the\n            real-time balancing of the system.\n        While it is not certain that all, or any, of these negative consequences may\nactually arise, there is sufficient concern to warrant a cautious approach to the issuance of\nFTRs in this market. The committee recommends an initial issuance of FTRs equal to no\nmore than 1/3 of the aggregate capacity of the associated transmission interfaces. These\nrights would have a duration of one year. If needed, to provide adequate incentive for the\nowners of existing transmission contracts (ETCs) to convert their rights and enter the ISO\nsystem, 100% of the capacity of these ETCs could be converted to FTRs upon entering\nthe ISO system, if this initial level of FTRs is not found to cause serious market power\nand system reliability problems. After this one year experiment, there should be a\nrigorous assessment of: (1) the performance of the market for evidence of market power,\n(2) the impact of the FTRs on congestion management, and (3) the need for additional\nFTRs or the need to continue with these experimental FTRs at all.\n        The MSC and its advisors see no significant economic benefit to California\nconsumers from giving scheduling priority to holders of financial transmission rights.\nHedging inter-regional price differentials due to transmission constraints can be\naccomplished by purely financial transmission rights with no scheduling authority, if all\nscheduling coordinators submit incs and decs in accordance with the ISO’s congestion\nmanagement protocols. If scheduling coordinators submit sufficient bids on all links,\ncongestion will be cleared and there will there no need to impose the default usage\ncharge, and use the scheduling priority. Consequently, given the significant potential\ncosts to the market and California consumers discussed above, a very cautious policy\ntowards FTRs seems prudent at this time.\n

Appendix B\n            Divestiture of PG&E Hydro Resources and Market Power Mitigation\n              Anjali Sheffrin, California ISO Department of Market Analysis\n                                       August 6, 1999\n                                         Summary\nThe legislature has requested that we analyze the market power risks of several\nalternatives to the plan to transfer the entire PG&E hydro portfolio to a non-regulated\nsubsidiary (the whole transfer). Since we do not know what the final divestiture design\nwill be, we reviewed four possible divestiture scenarios and evaluated the potential\nmarket power risk of each. Based on our preliminary analysis, we believe that potential\nrisks from alternative disposition of the PG&E hydro portfolio can be mitigated in each\nalternative. In each case, it will be necessary to have the flexibility to design measures\nto mitigate the specific risks that will emerge. It is important that legislation not attempt\nto prescribe one specific remedy in advance.\nIn analyzing the specific scenarios, we find there is an increased likelihood of market\npower if the divested hydro asset is owned by a market participant who also operates\nthermal or other generation resources in the California energy market. We expect there\nwill be less chance that a participant could exert market power if the hydro asset is\ndivested among many owners having no other generation resources. The key provisions\nof the principles proposed by PG&E and the ISO for mitigating market power for the\nwhole transfer (the “Principles”) can be applied to most of the divestiture scenarios.\nHowever, the specific percentage of minimum bid quantity requirement may need to be\nmodified for different conditions. In the event that the new hydro owners also operate\nother thermal resources in the California energy market, the bid requirement should be\nextended to the combined portfolio of the new owner to effectively mitigate the potential\nfor market power.\nIn designing market power mitigation, our overriding principle is to create correct\nincentives for market participants rather than relying on extensive and continuous\nmonitoring and imposing quantity and price restrictions. The need for monitoring\nbehavioral rules can become burdensome if there are numerous market participants\nsubject to these restrictions. In those cases structural remedies such as divestiture to a\nlarge number of suppliers, or contractual remedies, such as requiring the output of the\nfacility to be sold in advance so there is no profit from manipulating market prices, are\nworthy of consideration. In all cases, the ISO would require the flexibility to design the\nmost effective rules.\nBackground\nThe traditional sources of market power in any market are inelastic demand in the\nmarket (demand not responsive to price changes) and concentrated supply with limited\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 140 of 148\n"

[142] "capacity. The ISO ancillary service markets face both of these problems. Ancillary\nservices purchase quantities are fixed amounts based on reliability criteria and cannot\nvary in response to prices. As a result, the ISO's demand for ancillary services is inelastic.\nThe available supply of ancillary services is also smaller than that for energy generation\ndue to the requirement that generation units be able to immediately respond to dispatch\ninstructions. The ancillary service capability is concentrated among few suppliers with\nPG&E hydro units being the dominant supplier in many hours of the ancillary service\nmarkets. These factors constitute the market power risk of hydroelectric generation\noperation.\nThere are three main options for market power mitigation in California energy market:\n•   Structural. Divesting hydro resources among a large number of suppliers.\n•     Contractual. Allowing contractual agreements, such as Contracts for Differences\n    (CFDs), under which an owner, in effect, sells output at a fixed price under a long-\n    term contract. Currently, CFDs cannot be used in California’s markets due to CPUC\n    restrictions on investor-owned utility loads entering into bilateral contracts.\n • Behavioral Rules. Rules on bid quantities and prices like those proposed in the\n     Principles developed by the ISO and PG&E.\nThe current ISO/PG&E Principles, proposed to apply to the transfer of PG&E’s\nhydroelectric portfolio to an unregulated subsidiary, are an example of behavioral rules\nand include the following key provisions:\n    •   Constraints on both price and quantity of bids in energy market and ancillary\n        service capacity market;\n    •   The new owner must to act as a “price taker” when it has market power to set\n        prices for ancillary services (A/S)\n    •   Minimum bid quantities and bid price caps for A/S markets are set so the owner\n        can earn an equal or greater profit than if its capacity was committed to energy\n        markets\n    •   When competitive market conditions exist, the owner is allowed to bid in all\n        markets\n    •   Bi-lateral sales are subject to restrictions to ensure that the subsidiary may not\n        inappropriately withhold the purchased capacity from the market or that PG&E\n        cannot transfer any “market power” to its subsidiary.\nThe exact requirements for any possible divestiture outcome must consider specific\nfactors such as:\n  • The total amount and type of generation resources owned by the entity.\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 141 of 148\n"

[143] " • The amount and type of other generation resources available relative to demand in the\n      California energy and ancillary service markets.\n• The possibility that other means to mitigate market power mitigation, such as\n    Contracts for Differences and long term contracts may become available.\nScenario Analysis\nThere are a number of ways in which PG&E’s hydro generation could be divested.\nCompared to whole transfer option, there can be increased or reduced market power risk.\n− Base Line Scenario: A transfer of the entire hydro portfolio to one unregulated\n    company not operating any thermal generation units in the California energy market.\n    The proposed Principles are designed to mitigate market power under this scenario.\n    This is used as a basis to compare the market power of other scenarios.\n− Increased Market Power Scenario: The entire hydro portfolio or a majority of it is\n    transferred to a company who also operates thermal generation units in the California\n    energy market. In this scenario, increased market power mitigation is required. The\n    requirements of the Principles would have to be extended to the owner's entire\n    portfolio.\n− Medium Market Power Scenario: No new owner of the hydro facility owns more than\n    50% of the PG&E hydro capacity and any resulting combined hydro and thermal\n    capacity is less than the original PG&E hydro capacity (about 5000 MW), then the\n    new owner will have significant market power but less than in the Base line scenario.\n− Low Market Power Scenario: No new owner holds more than 20% of the PG&E\n    portfolio (about 1000 MW) and, either owns no other generation capacity or has\n    combined capacity of less than 20% of the total capacity in North of Path 15 zone.\n    Under this scenario the new hydro owner would have limited market power.\nWe can apply the behavioral rules of minimum quantity bid and bid price rules to market\npower mitigation in each of these scenarios. The general principles remain the same with\nspecific value for minimum bid quantity and maximum bid price adjusted to reflect the\nportfolio of the new owner. In the case when a new owner owns other generation in\naddition to the hydro capacity purchased from PG&E, a critical modification of the\nprinciples would be to base restrictions on the combined generation capacity of the new\nowner. The bid requirement, for example, would be calculated based on the combined\nportfolio and applied to both new hydro capacity and existing capacity.\nThe reason to apply the bid restriction to the combined capacity of the new owner is that\neven if the new owner were to be a price taker by bidding its entire new hydro capacity at\nzero price (which would be more than fulfilling the minimum requirement), it may still\nhave more market power with its other resources than before the purchase. It can be\ndemonstrated that a new owner who purchased 1000 MW of PG&E hydro and owns\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 142 of 148\n"

[144] "another 1200 MW of other generation capacity, has greater ability to inflate the market\nprice than it had before the purchase even if it bids the entire 1000 MW hydro at zero\nprice. The new owner would only need to withhold, for example 1000 MW of its other\ngeneration capacity, to inflate the market price and maximize profit. The 1000 MW of\nhydro capacity, although bid at zero price, will receive the market clearing price inflated\nby its actions and earn a profit higher.\nWhen the new owner operates more than 5000 MW of generation in California, the\nminimum bid quantity requirement, both in terms of the absolute MW value or the\npercentage of its total capacity would need to be increased to effectively mitigate its\nmarket power. Due to the increased market power risk, this scenario should be avoided if\npossible.\nIt is very likely, however, that the current percentages in the Principles will be adequate\nfor the medium market power and low market power scenarios.

[145] "                                      Methodology\n                         Options to Mitigate Market Power\nThere are three mains options for market power mitigation in California energy market:\n•   Structural. This includes divestiture of the hydro resource to a large number of\n    suppliers. One option is divestiture by watershed to a number of different owners.\n    The issue of whether each individual watershed is significantly small so that an entity\n    holding only that one set so resources would need to be addressed by a more detailed\n    study. In addition, for this option to provide an effective mitigation against market\n    power, entities purchasing hydro assets must not own significant other thermal\n    resources, so that transfer of ownership reduces or protects market power, rather than\n    creating or exacerbating market power.\n•   Contractual. This option includes contractual agreements, such as Contracts for\n    Differences (CFDs), under which an owner, in effect, sells output at a fixed price\n    under a long term contract. If the quantity of an owners portfolio that is effectively\n    “sold” under such long-term contracts is sufficiently large, this can removes an\n    incentive for the owner to exercise market power to raise market prices by\n    withholding capacity form the market (or bidding capacity at very high prices and\n    increasing revenues by selling less at a higher price). This contractual form of\n    mitigating market power is widely used in England, Australia, and is being proposed\n    in New York. CFDs are currently prevented from being applied in California’s\n    markets due to CPUC restrictions on investor-owned utility loads entering into\n    bilateral contracts.\n•   Behavioral Rules. These are restrictions on bid quantities and prices, such as have\n    been proposed in the Principles developed by the ISO and PG&E. These Principles\n    were developed as a set of market power mitigation measures that would be sufficient\n    to cover a scenario in which the entire PG&E’s hydro portfolio were sold to an\n    unregulated subsidiary. The bidding restrictions are designed to restrain the two\n    means to exercise market power: bidding excessive price and withholding capacity.\n    The generation owners can either bid significantly above cost or reduce its supply in\n    the market (with or without excessive bid price) and thus reduce total market supply\n    and push up market price. Bidding restriction must be set both as a quantity\n    requirement and bid-price cap. The proposed Principles for transfer of the PG&E\n    hydroelectric portfolio to a subsidiary is an example of behavioral rules used in\n    market power mitigation.\nThe appropriateness and details of using any of these approaches (individually or in\ncombination) must be addressed on a case by case basis, based on factors such as:\n  • The total amount and type of generation resources owned by the entity.\n  • The amount and type of other generation resources available relative to demand in the\n     California energy and ancillary service markets.\n                         MSC Report,

We made two assumptions in our projection: First, power plants in\nthe same river basin would be sold entirely to one new owner. Second, public agencies\nwith joint ownership of the shared hydro facilities of PG&E would buy most of the\nPG&E share. PG&E would retain only one of the shared facilities. In this case, excluding\nthe units to be purchased by public agencies, there would be 5 blocks of PG&E hydro\nsystem on sale\nRiver Basin                   Capacity (MW)

[147] "than 1000 MW of hydro. Other firms may fall in the low market power category if each\nbuys only one block of the PG&E hydro and does not own significant amount of other\ngeneration capacity. The increased market power scenario becomes possible if one\ncompany purchases the entire hydro capacity and also owns other generation capacity or\nacquires additional generation capacity in the future.\nMarket Power of Alternative Divestiture Scenarios for PG&E Hydro\nSystem Configuration\nBased on the system configuration and our two assumptions, there are, at most, 5 blocks\nof PG&E hydro system subject to sale or divestiture. (The misc. block can be further\ndivided, but considered as one block for market power analysis due to its small capacity).\nBased on these assumptions, we have attempted a crude classification of market power\nrisk based on FERC's rule that no one owner should control more than 20% market share.\nWe recommend further evaluations of the appropriate market power mitigation\nmeasures, and a more carefully look at the structural remedies and contract for\ndifferences methods for mitigating market power.\nAlternative Divestiture Scenarios Using the 5 Blocks\nScenario 1. PG&E retains greater than 50% share of hydro system.\nIf PG&E or its subsidiary retains the majority share of the current PG&E hydro system\n(50% or more), including Helms pump storage, then PG&E should be subject to some\nmonitoring and bid restrictions.\nThe Principles discussed by the ISO and PG&E can be modified to apply to PG&E in this\nscenario. The price cap should remain the same. The minimum quantity required for\nancillary services and forward energy market may need to be adjusted. There are two\nmain factors that affect these requirements: they would have lower market share which\nreduces market power, therefore it would be possible to reduce the minimum quantity\nrequirements; however the higher market power of other hydro owners (especially if the\nnew owners also own thermal resources) may require increased PG&E supply to curb\nothers’ market power. Additional study would be required to determine the appropriate\nquantity rules.\nAny buyer who purchases less than 1000 MW of hydro and does not own other\ngeneration capacity would be considered a low risk of having market power. They would\nnot be subject to any restriction initially and would be monitored. Restrictions may be\napplied if a significant market power problem is detected.\nAny buyer who purchases more than 1000 MW of hydro or owns other generation\ncapacity would be considered to pose a market power risk. See discussion in Scenario 4.\nScenario 2. Full divestiture to 5 non-thermal owners – The Helms owner will be the main\nmarket power concern. Others pose low market power concerns.\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 146 of 148\n"

[148] "In this scenario, PG&E retains less than 50% of total hydro. The 5 blocks would be\ndivested to five different firms who do not already own thermal or other generation\nresources.\nIn this scenario, only the firm who owns Helms pump storage facility may be subject to\nrestrictions. Other new hydro owners should be considered as low risk for market power.\nThe restrictions on the owner of Helms would be different than those in the Principles.\nFirst, the new Helms owner has a moderate market share ( less than 35%). Second,\npumped storage has special characteristics. The current principles would be modified\nsignificantly for Helms.\nScenario 3. Full Divestiture to Small Thermal Owners – Market power concern slightly\nmore than scenario 2\nUnder the following conditions, this scenario will be similar to scenario 2:\n1. Helms does not go to a thermal owner;\n2. Other buyers each have less than 1000 MW new hydro capacity;\n3. Each new owner’s combined hydro and thermal capacity is less than 20% of total\n    NP15 ISO market generation capacity.\nIn this case, the Helms owner may be regulated as in scenario 2, and the other firms will\nbe considered low risk in market power and will need only to be monitored.\nScenario 4. Divestiture to Large Thermal Owners – higher market power risk, may be\nhigher market power than the base line case.\nThis scenario covers the following high market power risk conditions:\n1. Helms goes to a company who also operates thermal or other generation capacity in\n    ISO market; or\n2. Any new owner purchases more than 1000 MW of hydro; or\n3. Any new owner with thermal or other generation capacity and its total capacity\n    including the new hydro capacity in NP15 is more than 20% of the total capacity in\n    NP15.\nAny of these conditions can potentially result in significant market power. If a new\nowner’s combined capacity is more than the current PG&E hydro portfolio (about 5000\nMW), it may have market power greater than the base line whole transfer case. Due to\nthe serious market power concern, we recommend that no new owner of PG&E hydro\nshould operate a combined generation capacity of more than 5000 MW in California\nEnergy market.\nThese owners should be regulated by some measures. Possible options include:\n1. Bid Cap and Quantity requirement to both hydro and thermal units of the new owner.\n    When a large new owner operates both hydro and thermal, restriction on hydro alone\n                        MSC

[149] "    may not be effective. Thermal units may be put under variable cost-based bidding\n    under certain market conditions, and will be required to bid more than certain\n    minimum quantities. When the new owner operates more than 5000 MW of\n    generation in California, the minimum bid quantity requirement, both in terms of the\n    absolute MW value or the percentage of its total capacity may be increased to\n    effectively mitigate its market power.\n2. Contracts for ancillary services such as Contracts for Differences. With properly\n    designed contracts, spot market prices do not change the contract holder’s revenue\n    and profit. The contract holder, therefore, has no incentive to inflate market prices.\nAdditional Study\nThis has been a cursory evaluation. We recommend further research to properly design\nthe restrictions. Areas that will require further study are the following:\n − When and how often will ancillary services be purchased separately for NP15 and\n     SP15?\n − What season and hours do these split purchases happen? What is the system load and\n     the ancillary services requirements under these conditions? What are the ancillary\n     services prices under these conditions?\nThis research will assist us in reaching a conclusion on how often we would expect to see\nmarket conditions that could be prone to market power problems.\n                        MSC Report, October 18, 1999, Page 148 of 148\n"
