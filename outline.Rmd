### Information sought

Prior to the investigation that resulted in the an initial staff report, FERC received a report from the California agency responsible for operating the electric energy exchange that FERC was concerned that the market had been manipulating.^[Frank A. Wolak, Chairman, Market Surveillance Committee of California Independent System Operator, *Report on Redesign of California Real-Time Energy and Ancillary Services Markets* dated October 18, 1999], which will be referred to as the [Wolak report].

The [Wolak report] was prepared before FERC began its investigation, did not rely on the Enron email corpus^[The report does not even name Enron.] and provides a lengthy analysis of the indicia of the exercise of market power in the California electricity wholesale market. A topical and keyword digest was prepared, as discussed below, to identify subjects of interest in the corpus.

### Resulting dataset

For purposes of this paper, the resulting tibble has been serialized to an `Rda` [file](https://s3-us-westâ€“2.amazonaws.com/dslabs.nostromo/g_enron.Rda) of approximately [ ] size, which can be brought into an `R` session with the following 

      # syntax to load Rda from S3
      con <- url("https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dslabs.nostromo/g_enron.Rda")
      load(con)
      close(con)
